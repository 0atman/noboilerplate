# NoBoilerplate Discord Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

### Our Goal

The goal of this document is to set the overall tone for our community. This isn’t an exhaustive list of things you can and can't do. Rather, take this document in the spirit in which it’s intended, and try to be your best self.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by 0atman/NAMTAO/Tris. This includes, but is not limited to, the NAMTAO Productions Discord server, NoBoilerplate/LostTerminal/ModemPrometheus repositories on GitHub and the NoBoilerplate YouTube-channel. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

The NoBoilerplate Code of Conduct applies equally to all members of the community, including staff.

## Rules

1. Don't forget to be awesome.
2. Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism or hate speech will be tolerated.
3. No spam or unsolicited self-promotion (server invites, advertisements etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members.
4. If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, report it to Modmail.
5. No age-restricted or obscene content (outside of the #mature-themes-lt channel). This includes text, images or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence or other disturbing graphic content.
6. Stay on topic: Please take heated argument with little chance of resolution (such as politics or emacs vs vim!) to a thread in #⁠the-forum.
7. Posting Malware, Viruses, Fork/Zip Bombs etc., even for educational purposes. Linking to them with a disclaimer is fine.
8. Don't be a dick.
