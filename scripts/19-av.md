Hi friends my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast, technical videos.

No matter what you create on the internet, if I can hear you, you need to sound good.
In this video I'm going to give away all my secrets to making great-sounding videos or podcasts, on a tight budget.

# `$ BEEP 440`

notes:
I've been a music producer since I typed beep 440 on my first 8 bit machine back in the 90s.

This has given me the ability to make good quality sounds using computers, and the high standards that mean I'm never satisfied with what I've done.

Why should you care about audio?

---

![[man-child-talking.jpg|600]]

notes:
Humans communicate primarily with speech, it's absolutely FOUNDATIONAL to us.
Reading is good, as are pretty pictures on the screen, the first is intellectual, the second, instinctual, but neither are the foundation of our communication.

Speaking to someone, like I am to you now, is the most fundamental, personal, and effective method of communication we have.

How do you make this as good as possible. If you're short on time, Let me give you the 4 step tldr:

---

1. 🎤 Shure SM58
2. 💻 $100 audio interface
3. 👩‍🎤 Record using Reaper.fm
4. 📒 Keep practising

notes:

- Buy a second hand SM58
- plug that into a usb sound card that shouldn't cost more than $100
- The software I recommend is Reaper
- Start now, and keep practising till you sound good.

That last step is more nuanced than you might think.

If you would like to know more, keep watching.
My hardware recommendations are perfectly simple, they're not really the limiting factor. I will go into detail after we talk more about point 4.

What good is the best microphone in the world, if your words are boring.

- Your words must be as good as you can make them
- It starts with what you say
- Don't drop the needle onto the record of your mind and call it a day
- speak your script out loud, let it bounce off the walls of your room and into your brain.
- Never act surprised by what you're saying, repeat it until it's no longer a surprise to you

Let me tell you how to write good stories.

# Part 1:

# A Case Study

notes:

In July of 2020 I was burnt out. I took a week off from my programming job to get my head straight, and by thursday of that week I had decompressed enough to start thinking properly. I realised that I could make a really great fiction experience using the technology I had developed to make a music videos for my cover of Still Alive, the Portal 2 credits song:

---

&mdash; [My cover of "Still Alive"](https://youtu.be/k6giW_6_bFY)

notes:

The look of this 80s scrolling text on a CRT REALLY inspired me. I could make something retro, but futuristic! And so I started brainstorming what would become my podcast, Lost Terminal

---

# Working Within My Constraints

notes:

I had the seed of an idea: A computer that communicated through a text terminal. I'd never seen anything like that. But what of the story, and of the world? I had never done something like this before, so I took stock of my experience, both good and bad:

---

| Good                   | Bad                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Music experience       | No video experience   |
| Love speaking          | No writing experience |
| Terminal visualisation | Standard nerd |

notes:

### Good

 - I'm a music producer, writing music and, probably, sound effects would be possible
 - I love public-speaking (as should be obvious to you) so I could voice whatever I write, and
 - The scrolling terminal video method was ready to go

### Bad

 - I have no video production experience
 - Nor much story writing experience
 - And I'm not a very emotional person - could I even write impactful stories?

---

![[Screenshot_20230209_124000.png]]

[Lost Terminal 1.1](https://youtu.be/p3bDE9kszMc)

notes:

So I put these constraints together to build the setting of a single-person-narrator, who speaks to us through a computer. The character would use text-to-speech, so we can't hear his environment, so he would be an A.I. - that would release me from recording sound effects as a typical radio show would include.

Also, and I must get a little personal here, I realised that my non-neural-typical condition, autism, could be turned into an asset, not a liability. Though I feel very under-qualified to talk about emotions and mental-health issues, I do feel uniquely qualified to write about a computer who is slowly understanding human emotion. You gotta work with what you've got!

---

# Part 2: What I Have Learned Along The Way

notes:

A summary of my advice in the next few sections is simply to write for yourself. Write the stories you, or perhaps your younger self, want or wanted to hear. It's much easier to know what will be well-received if you are both audience and author.

---

# Genre & Setting

notes:

First, if you are writing fiction, you must choose a genre, which is often closely linked to the setting. This can be anything from sci-fi to satire or horror. This is the canvas you will frame your story on. In many ways, both the genre and setting are unrelated to the story and themes you want to explore. Star Wars could be rewritten in Renaissance Venice and it would have just the same message of hope and rebellion (and, as a bonus, it would still have cool swords!).
Choose a genre you are familiar with; choose one you like.

As well as the setting, also consider the way you present the story in terms of narration. There are many options for you to consider:

---



 - Present tense or past tense
 - Single-person narrator / full cast 
 - Bespoke background music
 - Sound effects

notes:


 - Present tense or past tense?
 - Will you have a single-person narrator, or a full cast of voice actors?
 - How about bespoke background music?
 - what of sound effects?
 - etc.

We must all work to our constraints. If you've got enthusiastic and talented friends, you've got a ready-made cast! Recording will be more complicated, but you will manage. However if it's just you with a microphone in your bedroom, like I'm doing now, that's also fine.

My recommendation is to understand your constraints and let them shape the setting. Some of the best and most influential stories are told by a single person whispering in to a microphone - and you can always add more people later! The most important thing is to START.

---

# Themes & Topics

notes:

This is what your story or video or podcast is REALLY about. Not the location, not the framing, not even the story and characters.

The BIG THEMES your characters explore within the framing of the world are what you will be writing about mostly: Environmentalism, class struggle, slavery, mental health, the meaning of art, the meaning of LIFE. The topics are the reason you want to write. The topics are the reason you NEED to write.

The topic and themes should get you out of bed in the morning. They should make you proud of what you write, make you hunger to learn more about it, so you can better distil that information down into your work; and here's the most important thing: To leave people richer and better for experiencing your story.

It's OK to start with a simple story or a character concept that you think is fun, but that won't keep you going. As you're writing your first draft or pilot episode, look for the themes and topics that are creeping in to your work. Your brain won't let you write about anything else. Seize them.

---

# Story

notes:

You may know how to write a story, you may not. When I started writing [Lost Terminal](http://www.lostterminal.com) I certainly didn't. But I have good news for you, if you believe Kurt Vonnegut there are only 6 stories in the world.


They are:

---

 - **Rags to riches** 
 - **Tragedy** 
 - **Man in a hole** 
 - **Icarus** 
 - **Cinderella** 
 - **Oedipus** 

&mdash; _[Kurt Vonnegut, On The Shapes Of Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP3c1h8v2ZQ)_

notes:

 - **Rags to riches** (a story that follows a rise in happiness)
 - **Tragedy**, or **riches to rags** (one that follows a fall in happiness)
 - **Man in a hole** (fall–rise)
 - **Icarus** (rise–fall)
 - **Cinderella** (rise–fall–rise), and,
 - **Oedipus** (fall–rise–fall).

Write one of these if you are having trouble coming up with your own - it doesn't matter. As I said before, the real impact isn't the plot arc, it's the themes of your story. Sure, it's fun to have a cute satellite protagonist, but the deep themes will be what people come back for again and again.

# Writing

> "You sit down at the keyboard and you put one word after another until its done. It's that easy, and that hard."

&mdash; Neil Gaiman

notes:
How to write, according to Neil Gaiman, is that "You sit down at the keyboard and you put one word after another until its done. It's that easy, and that hard."

Writing to the regular schedule required by a serialised video or podcast can take two forms:
1. Write it all beforehand and record to your schedule.
2. Write it just in time to your recording schedule.

Though the former is more relaxing and safer, I'm going to argue you do the latter.
At least at first

Like many of us, I struggle with getting things done. When there are no deadlines other than those I create, it seems like I can finish my projects whenever, which of course actually means 'never'. There are tools and projects that helped me in the past, the only novel I've ever finished was because I committed, very loudly and publicly, to [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org), and smashed 1600 words into my laptop every day for a month. Though I'm very proud of what I wrote, I don't think the pace is sustainable for a video or podcast, and I certainly didn't have any fun.
I recommend a much more sedentary 500 words per day. This allows you, if you like, to have a 20-minute episode completed in one week.
Here is my schedule, for your interest:

---


| DAY            | TASKS                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tuesday-Friday | Edit this week's episode, and write next week's episode  |
| Saturday       | Record this week's episode                               |
| Sunday         | Edit audio and music.                                    |
| Monday         | Publish episode                                          |
| Tuesday        | Do it all again                                          |

notes:
I get up early and do this before my day job. It only takes an hour, and means that I give my best, most focused time to my project. Some of you will be night owls and can do this at night, others have busy lives and can only spare a lunch break - choose a schedule that works for you.

You can bunch those up and record a whole season of them, or as I've said, you could release them straight away. Why would we subject ourselves to this hectic schedule? Motivation and feedback.

---

# Motivation

> No piece of writing is ever finished ...
> It's just due.

&mdash; Bill Condon

notes:

Motivation for me relates to the thrill of FINISHING something. _"But what if I'm not finished editing"_ I hear you cry. I have good news: The work is never finished. As Bill Condon says, simply, _"No piece of writing is ever finished. It's just due."_.
So, you get it as good as you can do, and then you record. The act of recording, of speaking the script out loud, is a huge advantage that book authors do not always have. It's a great check, in my experience, and errors are corrected either consciously or unconsciously, while speaking.

---

# Feedback

notes:

Feedback is VERY USEFUL, especially when you're starting out. If you keep your script to yourself, you'll never improve. If you get an editor, you'll have two heads to improve it. But releasing it to the world for comment will get you 1,000x that.
You also might find aspects of the story people pick up on that you didn't even notice. Maybe they love the background character you put in for just one paragraph - Time to give that person their own arc!

And, of course, positive feedback and praise is very motivating.

---

# Planning

notes:

If you, as I recommend, record and publish early episodes before later episodes have been written, you may worry about how to guarantee continuity.
While I made some small mistakes in my pilot episode, both factual and plot-related, no-one cares. Not ONE person has pointed out the errors. They have, I imagine, forgotten them under the weight of subsequent episodes. This happens all the time, to professionals in every industry, from TV shows to movie series.

Allow yourself leniency in your first episode for small errors. You have to, otherwise you'd never get the damn thing started!

But, for the rest of your story, you must plan.

> Knowing the destination is a big help when planning the trip.

&mdash; Neil Murton, author of ["Magpie Tales"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bt-FHaFVH8)

notes:

A good friend of mine Neil Murton, collaborator on our podcast Modem Prometheus gave me some advice when I was starting out:

> Knowing the destination is a big help when planning the trip.

Simply, this means: **YOU. MUST. PLAN.**

Once you've chosen your plot arc (or chosen one of the 6 plots Kurt Vonnegut has identified) write it down in a table, and sketch out for yourself what happens for each of the plot-lines in your series (there can be overlapping plots for each important character).
My advice for this is to start at the end, the resolution, then the start, then the mid-point, then fill in the details.
"Dan Wells has a great video on his take on story structure you should watch. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmiqQ9NpPE>"

So how do you record all of this? If you have no budget, you use the device you currently have in your pocket at all times.

notes:

- Microphones are very clever, your phone has a great one built in to it
- You don't need room treatment to reduce echoes if you hold the mic close to your mouth
- you you can even use a cheap microphone if you hold it right next to your mouth.
- Your phone mic works best if you hold it in the way it was designed to work.

# Phone Audio

(not bad!)

notes:

"Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone."

# My Mic Sitting on My Desk

# Same Mic, 2cm from Mouth

(perfection!)

notes:

"Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind."

If you don't believe me, Watch this video by Andrew Huang where he used his macbook microphone to record a whole album!

---

![[pexels-polina-tankilevitch-7382466.jpg]]

notes:

Hold your phone like this and you'll sound great in your recordings.

To get started, use your phone for video, and record your voiceover audio up-close with your phone too.

But maybe you've got a small budget, what should you buy? if so?

---

![[SM58.png]]

notes:
I only have one recommendation here, if you're starting out:
Buy a second hand Shure SM58. The more beaten up it looks the better, you'll pay less money for it, and it'll probably sound fine.
Get it from your local music store or ebay, don't pay more than 50 or 60 dollars.
You should never be afraid of spending money on the SM58, it will last your entire life, and if you have any construction work you need to do around the house, you can use it to hammer in nails with.

---

![[obama-sm57.jpg]]

notes:

(You can also use the SM57 if it's easier for you to get hold of, it's basically the same microphone, but this one is less good for heavy construction projects because it has less shielding)

Every U.S. president since Lyndon B. Johnson has delivered speeches through an SM57. That's since 1963.

![[audio-interfaces-engadget.png|700]]

_(image credit: Al Griffin, Engadget)_

notes:

Don't buy a blue yeti microphone, don't buy any usb microphone.

The slight increase in complexity is worth it, trust me.

Your SM58 has an XLR connector on it and the signal is so low that it requires amplification up to the line level your PC can use.
Both these are the job of an external USB audio interface.

They come in all shapes and sizes, buy the cheapest second hand one you can find that has good reviews from Scarlett, TASCAM, Behringer and so on.

If you don't want to search around, I use and recommend the red interface at the top right, the Scarlet 2i2.
It's Plug and play, even on linux.

---

![[Pasted image 20230202184004.png]]

notes:
Let's talk software.

You will read in many recommendations for getting started with audio editing to use Audacity.

I love Audacity, you should absolutely have it installed for quick edits. It's open source, works everywhere, including compiled into webassembly at webacity.com.

However, it's just slightly too bare-bones for anything more than trivial work. Feel free to start here, I certainly did, but the choice isn't this or spending big money on audio software. You should use Reaper.

---


![[reaper-screenshot.png]]

# [Reaper.fm](http://Reaper.fm)
notes:

Reaper has all the built-in plugins you could need, is lightning fast, and can even edit video, and has an unlimited free trial version.
I'm editing this audio and video right now in reaper, in addition to being the best audio editor I've used, it's also the best video editor I've used.

Reaper is not open source, but before that puts you off let me redeem it with two facts:

One, linux is natively supported, alongside the usual suspects of windows and osx, but it feels like the reaper developers REALLY care about linux support, it works on raspberry pi and even on the new M1 mac hardware, runnin on asahi linux.

The second reason is sentimental. It's built by <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Frankel,> who made among other things:

![[Pasted image 20230202184909.png|400]]

notes:
winamp.

And if you were listening to napster music in the 90s as I was, this might hit rather hard.

Winamp was basically free, I don't know anyone who paid for it.
Redeem your karma by paying Justin $60 for Reaper, after you've tried it.

| Plugin     | Settings                      |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Gate       | Room noise @ -54dB            |
| Equaliser   | HP 92Hz, boost 646Hz + 4291Hz |
| Compressor | @ -33dB w/ make-up            |

notes:

- I recommend reaper, but whatever you use, you only need three basic plugins.
There are a million plugins available, people will love to sell you some, but you need only three, and they will be built-in to your audio editor:
	- A gate set to just above your room noise floor, mine is about -54dB
	- An equaliser set to your vocal range, I used the male preset and tweaked from there, and
	- A Compressor, to even out the volume of your recording, with make-up options to boost quiet sections, and limits so you don't get too hot.
