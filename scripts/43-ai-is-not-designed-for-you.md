Hi friends my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, where I make fast, technical videos.

So, Apple Intelligence has been out for a month now, but like a lot of tech today, it's a bit underwhelming, right?

_Blade Runner_ (2017)

notes:

- The AI hype train is driven by the tantalising promise of AGI, general intelligence, like we see in the movies:
	- Maria, HAL, Marvin, Johnny Five, C-3PO, Rachel & Deckard, Data, Holly, JARVIS, WALL-E
- But, despite 4 years of promises, Apple Intelligence is the latest example of these products missing the mark.

## _"Almost useless."_

&mdash; ["An honest review of Apple Intelligence", MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haDjmBT9tu4)

notes:

## Apple Intelligence

The best two things that Marques, here, has to say about Apple Intelligence are:
1. The background eraser tool is pretty good, and,
2. it has bumped up the base ram across all of Apple's hardware line-up
    - This is well overdue, as I mentioned in my video on [[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Linux Workstations]]

Apple Intelligence was announced at WWDC in June 2024, but didn't ship with the brand new iphones and the other hardware that was announced then, and only after months were these mediocre features released to us.

The _really good_ stuff is coming, we are promised.

Where have we heard that before?

# Part 1:

## WHO IS FLYING THIS THING?

notes:
To understand what is happening with AI, it's useful to look at two other examples of tech that had HUGE hype but fell short of expectations.

# â‚¿itcoin

![[Excalidraw/timeline-web-vs-bitcoin.svg]]

notes:

We'll start with the fact that Bitcoin, the first decentralized blockchain, is now 15 years old.

To put that in perspective:
The web started in 1991. 15 years later, in 2006, we had youtube, twitter, amazon, ebay - the world was unrecognisable.

What have we got in that timeframe from #blockchain?
Ashes.

*"A thriving market for magic beans doesn't make the magic beanstalk real."*

&mdash; [lib.rs/cryptography/cryptocurrencies](https://lib.rs/cryptography/cryptocurrencies)

notes:

I agree with this, but you CAN sell something that is not real, you just have to promise it will be at some point...

Blockchain technology isn't new, Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation.
("Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups")

but, no real-world use was found until Bitcoin, in 2006, as people realised they could make money with it, or make it into money, perhaps.

Since then, the only blockchain success stories are
- the occasional flickers of alternate coins, like mayflies living and dying in a single night,
- and startups with no products but a lot of promises.

The promises, just like with AI, I think, are the point.

### The Cybertaxi & Optimus

notes:

The second and final example I'll contrast AI with, is Tesla's recent cybertaxi/robot event.
This was WEIRD right? was this supposed to impressed us?
- Disney has been operating autonomous cars on a closed track for decades
	- (they call them RIDES)
- the fancy robots were not autonomous, they were driven by remote human operators
	- We've seen this forever, too, from Hitachi to Boston Dynamics

With AI and blockchain and self-driving cars, all this tech we're bombarded with these days, it feel like they are all kindof falling short, doesn't it?

There's a reason for that:

Large Language Models Can only Learn Topics where there is a Large Amount of Language Available to train them.

## LLMs can't math

$$1+1=2$$

vs

$$2e^2+5j=0$$

notes:

For example, the reason LLMs can't do maths is because, apart from trivial examples, the state space of all numbers is too great to expect much existing training data

Contrast how often `1+1=2` is written in textbooks, easy for chatgput to do, with how often, say, `2e^2+5j=0` is.

One of these has a large amount of existing natural language data available for training, one does not.

![](attachments/chatgpt%20mistakes.jpg)

ChatGPT can make mistakes.

notes:

## Chatgpt

This is why tools like chatgpt seem good at first, when you ask it simple questions, but as you dig deeper, they fall apart and get increasingly inaccurate, or hit artificial guard rails and only provide surface level responses.

[matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/](https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/)

notes:

It's not that the technology is new, and will eventually get better, it's that this incredible language ability CAN ONLY WORK after being trained on large amounts of data.

By definition, there might be only a single PhD written about a very niche topic.
So GPT will never learn that information because a single PhD paper is not a large amount of language.

And if you don't have a large amount of language, you can't train a large language model.

AI companies can't fulfil their promises.

# another day, another blockchain

notes:

We hear so much about new blockchain tech and nothing about new blockchain products (other than more scam coins or nfts).

I think this is because, from my software engineer's perspective, when you actually try to use blockchain tech, you discover that it's far cheaper to make a simple server with an API to hold your data, rather than implement an entire decentralised network to hold your data.

Because, OF COURSE, it is.
When bills need to be paid, practicality beats purity every day.

Blockchain companies CAN'T fulfil their promises either.

What is happening here?

---

# Part 3:

## We are not the audience

notes:

All These Flashy Announcements Seem Weird and confusing, until You Realise We're not the Audience for Them

If you scratch the surface, these technologies don't work.
And things that don't work can't solve problems.
And you can't sell someone something that doesn't solve their problem, not twice anyway.

So why do these companies keep making these promises?
~~(it's capitalism)~~

# CAPITALISM IS WORKING FINE

notes:

- It's not demand from the customers
- Nor direction from their engineers,
- not even, really, by choices made by their CEOs.

It's because the real decision-makers in these companies are their wealthy investors.

- mediocre AI tools (that we all hate) have been crammed into everything we use - now even our notifications - because the companies have to impress investors with AI features, even if they don't work well
- Implementing a vapourware "blockchain strategy" isn't a feature that will help us, the users and customers, but it will help the company get investment.
- the tesla cybertaxi/robot event wasn't for us to get a look at actual future products, it was to generate hype for investors to see

## The Startup Runway

![[Excalidraw/startup runway.excalidraw.svg]]

notes:

When you work in tech startups, as I have over the past 15 years, you get to know the startup runway very well.

I wasn't always, as a lowly engineer, privy to the actual amount of funding coming in and salaries going out each month, but we would all be able to feel when the end of the runway was in sight.

You can typically extend your runway in two main ways:
1. Selling products and services to users for money
2. Persuading investors to part with more of their money

Selling products is HARD! They have to work!

But selling a promise? That's EASY.

_Shooting Fish_ (1997)

notes:

- GenAI is this perfect tool for tricking investors out of their money because, often enough, the people asking for the money think it works too!
- LLMs are great at basic stuff, and in the past when a computer could automate basic tasks to a good degree, it only required time, improvements, and of course money, to perfect.
	- As an investor, surely you'd better get in on the ground floor of this!
	- Just as you have before.

# Hypothesis:

## Maybe wealthy investors shouldn't be able to fsck up my notifications

notes:

Conclusion: From colonies on Mars to democratising money, it's always easier to promise a bright future than build a better present.

What I remind myself to do, whenever I see these bazaar products that no-one needs is to try to pay less attention to what these corps _SAY_ they will do in the future, and far more to what they actually _DO_ today.
