I uploaded the first of my Rust videos on the 21 Apr 2022 after a few people at work missed an intro to Rust presentation that I had given. I said no worries, I'd record a version and upload it to youtube for them to watch. 10 people did.

3 weeks later the youtube algorithm showed my video to 150k people, and my email was filled with comments and suggestions and well-wishes, and my life has not been the same.

notes:

Since then, I've set up the discord server, which now has about a thousand people on all talking about Rust, tech and nerdy stuff.

After much encouragement from lovely people on the discord, I have launched a patreon, where you can get VIP access to voice and chat channels, early videos, and my astonished gratitude.
