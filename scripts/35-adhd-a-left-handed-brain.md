# In a Right-<br>handed World

notes:

Hi friends my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast, technical videos.

This video is about ADHD.

Despite not being left-handed, I do have a great deal of empathy for our left-handed cousins.

A surprising number of left-handed people are ambidextrous.

This makes a lot of sense, there are many manual interfaces that are explicitly right-handed, from scissors to mice, to industrial machines.

Some tools, like scissors, you can get left-handed version of, of course.
You can fill your house with physical coping mechanisms that work.
But when you walk out into the world, you will find that everything isn't designed for you.

It's not fair, but
- if you are left-handed you must learn to be ambidextrous.
- Just as if you have ADHD, you must learn to cope in a neurotical world.

notes:

As I mentioned in my coping mechanisms video, I have ADHD.

I was diagnosed in school in the early 90s, and have recently started taking medication after an adult diagnosis.

I made this video to tell you my story, but also to share everything I've learned along the way.

Let's start with the big question:

---

# Part 1:
## Why Does it Seem Like
## Everyone Has ADHD
## These Days?

notes:

Why Does it Seem Like Everyone Has ADHD These Days?

It's partly just the slow march of medical and diagnostic progress:

The same proportion of the population have ADHD who have always had ADHD, but because we're able to diagnose and treat it so much better than even a decade or two ago, people are more aware of it.

---

![[left-handedness-graph.png]]

notes:

## Left Handed Analogy

It feels to me similar to the suppression of left-handedness in many countries around the turn of the last century, where children were forced to write with their right hand, despite about a tenth of them favouring the left.

This sinister practice died out in the 50s and the graph has been flat ever since, likely showing the true proportion of actual lefties.

It's important to note that the number of naturally left-handed people didn't actually increase, the people learning to be left dominant increased because *we stopped persecuting them*

---

#### The Number Hasn't Increased
## We just Stopped

## Persecuting Them

(maybe this explains other trends...)

![|200](https://www.prideflags.org/static/search/data/img/progress_pride_flag.svg)

notes:

This attitude shift for both left-handedness and ADHD is huge.

Instead of "Here's Timmy, he's a troublemaker" it's "Here's Timmy, he has ADHD"

One of those comments is destructive, and one of them is constructive.

# My Experience
# Childhood
notes:

#todo
- [ ] stigma, support the child without labelling the child. Dyslexia is what I thought I had

I am extremely lucky.
You can kind of reverse-engineer that from the knowledge that I'm a youtuber.
A lot of things had to align for us to be talking today.

As a child I had extremely severe ADHD, then called ADD, Dyslexia, plus the wildcard of Autism.
What a winning hand!

But in addition to those three interesting cards that fate dealt me, I had an ace. Or, two:

---

(artist's impression)

notes:

Both my parents, in addition to being wonderful supportive people, taught in primary school.

This meant that when their first-born son wasn't making eye contact as early as he should, and seemed more disruptive and distracted among other children, they took FAST action.

And it saved my life.

<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>
_"Tristram spends most of his time organising his desk and looking around at what other students are doing. This doesn't affect his work **because he doesn't do any**."_

notes:

My parents got me to a childhood psychologist who observed me in class, noting hilariously, that (quote)

After the diagnosis of ADHD, my parents lined up all the help I needed, fighting council budgets in our small rural schools.

I didn't learn foreign languages, I left my friends and took lessons in the special education department, and had a dedicated Ancillary teacher to keep me on task in every lesson.

What's astonishing is that despite attending a rural state school, this was all provided for me for free.

When I talk to my superhero parents about it, they said that they simply would not take no for an answer.

Every child has a right to equal education, and though you shouldn't have to, sometimes you must fight for it.

# So What is Adhd?

notes:

If you have a broken leg, there's a clear underlying condition that explains your symptoms. But with mental health, you can't always see the source of the problems.

ADHD, like many mental health conditions, is a classification of groups of symptoms that respond to common treatment, rather than a fixed underlying cause.

There are many hypothesised causes of ADHD, and the most dominant model is a Dopamine imbalance.

---

# Dopamine Imbalance

notes:

https://podcastnotes.org/huberman-lab/episode-39-controlling-your-dopamine-for-motivation-focus-satisfaction-huberman-lab/

Dopamine is my favourite brain chemical, and yours too.
It is part of the reward system in the brain.
Dopamine encourages activities that the brain thinks are good for us.

The brain gives us a huge dopamine hit after doing simple, primal activities: eating fatty foods, exercise, sex, entertainment.

But it also rewards us with a smaller amount of dopamine for for doing more cerebral activities:
- Cleaning your house,
- getting an early start that paper that is due next month
- daily practising art and music, or
- raking up leaves in the yard

In short, non-urgent tasks that you could just ignore.
Until you can't.

When we are children, our dopamine system, and understanding of the world, is not developed yet.
Our parents and teachers have to persuade us into doing non-primal but useful tasks.

Because we are rewarded by our parents and teachers for doing a Good Job in these endeavours, our brains and dopamine system learns this, and we start to build positive habits for ourselves.

But what if this system works in a different way?

---

# The ADHD Child

notes:

Imagine a child, like a young Tris, who doesn't get enough dopamine reward from doing good tasks.

Even before they can speak, they are learning through constant feedback that when they eat a lot, they get loads of dopamine - they feel good. Same with running around and playing, loads of dopamine there. FANTASTIC!

But sitting quietly because mummy told us to? no dopamine. No positive chemical re-enforcement.

Interesting.

We are slaves to our hormones, Dopamine especially, and children especially.

So by the tie the ADHD child goes to school, there is a marked difference in behaviour, and they ALL might be because of a atypical dopamine system:
- They're not intentionally disruptive in class, they're exhibiting dopamine-seeking behaviours.
- They're not greedy when eating, they're exhibiting dopamine-seeking behaviours
- They're not listening to you and instead looking at the children playing outside, because they're exhibiting dopamine-seeking behaviours
- They're not unable to read quietly, they're exhibiting dopamine-seeking behaviours
- They are not constnaly distracted, they're constantly engaging in dopamine-seeking behaviour

# After School

notes:

With all this support both in-school and outside, by the time I was 16, I was awarded "Most Improved" in our graduation ceremony, an award I felt was somewhat of a back-handed complement! And two years later. I was off to University.

How did I get to university? To quote Dave Lister, from Red dwarf:

---

![[lister-milkshake.png|800]]

notes:

> The same normal boring way everyone gets to university. I failed my exams and applied!

But now I was on my own, no-noe could tell me to pay attention in class, they couldn't even force me out of bed to go to class.

self-direction is a nightmare for someone with ADHD.

---

# University Experimentation

notes:

Starting university, in 2004, I had access to broadband internet for the first time.

This alloweed me to research ways to organise myself, what I would later come to know as _coping mechanisms_.

At this stage, I thought I was cured.
I had that 'most improved' award, after all. I was making eye contact like a champ, and my university grades were good.

However I knew that I was only scraping by.
I was legendarily forgetful, missing both social and school appointments regularly.

I started writing down as much as I could, reading early Lifehacker articles and blog posts.
I started building my elaborate coping mechanisms.

---

# University

notes:

- Didn't build enough any learning systems while at school
	- built enough coping machinsisms for school, not uni
- couldn't get by on smarts, everyone's smart here
- But with the diagnosis, I was able to use the university's systems set up for people with ADHD to just about get by.
- By the end of university, I was cured.
    - Or so I thought.
    - but we're always learning

notes:

## Graph of ADHD Cases since 2019

But it's also not just a slow evolution, there HAS been an enormous jump in the number of people RECENTLY.
And it's because of the nature of masking.

---

# Professional Life

notes:

Web development might be the best job in the world, it certainly was the best job for me:
It's naturally structured, with the work often agreed upon by the team, and divided up into byte-sized tasks.

The prevailing organisation system, scrum, had clear goals and structure that really worked for me, it was like solving a puzzle or playing a video game, but every day.
And they were paying me to do it!

I became senior very quickly, then team lead and everything was looking up.

I was experiencing masking, not pure victory as I thought.
And it happens to millions of people:

==My Advice==

## ADHD Doesn't Present Strongly in a Structured & Deadline Filled Environment

notes:

If you, like many people,
- wake up to an alarm,
- commute to your job for 8 or 9am,
- do whatever work your boss tells you to do,
- commute home and eat and then sleep,
- only to do it all over again the next day.

You might never notice you have ADHD.

Symptoms like executive dysfunction and choice paralysis and endless options just aren't luxuries available to you in the 9-to-5 life.

But guess what happened in 2020.

---

## THANKS CORONA, I Hate it

notes:

Suddenly, your boss begged you NOT to come into the office, working from home became mandatory.
And even after the lockdowns lifted, we discovered that in many cases, we didn't need the offices at all.

It suddenly seemed like insanity to go from your home, where you have an internet connection and a computer, to commute for an hour or more to sit at a noisy desk with an internet connection and a computer.

The illusion of the Victorian workhouse was shattered by the coronavirus lockdowns.

The world experimented, just briefly, with pausing infinite growth and grind:
- Smog lifted in Beijing and Delhi,
- Venice's canals ran clear, and
- And working from home became the new standard.

But this new-found autonomy, freedom, and self-direction was like a tsunami tide, first withdrawing and exposing all the rocks that were so carefully buried, and crashing down with the realisation that millions of people can't work outside the old frameworks.

---

# Let the Past Die
## Kill it if You Have to

notes:

The solution isn't to pack the people back into the workhouse again.
We're past that, for all the sabre-rattling of CEOs to get back to the office. That boat has sailed.
The leases on the office have been given up, and white-collar worker's eyes have opened to the fact that they were being tricked into giving away hours of their life commuting for literally no reason.

And the free market, darling of the very CEOs who demand the return to work, has seized upon this efficiency, and will not let it go.

---

# 2020

notes:

I survived the apocalypse, literally and figuratively, though many people did not. 
Both figuratively and literally.

Wfh did not seem to affect my ADHD like it did for so many others.
I think this was because I was already very async,
my structure came from systems (like JIRA and Trello and scrum) and so didn't change much.

The change for me came 2 years later:

---

## Self-Employment

##### Or
## Rust Ruined Everything

#### (In The Nicest Way)

notes:

- THIS is where it fell apart for me, when I went full-time on this channel.
- I created my first rust video (link) to show to a few colleagues who couldn't make my unhinged sermon about this incredible language I'd found.
    - I uploaded, sent the link to them, and it got 10 views and I thought nothing of it.
    - 2 weeks later, my email stopped loading one sleepy Sunday because I got so many comments overnight.
    - The algorithm gods had chosen me, and I started writing more videos.
- After a whirlwind 6 months, I went full time on this channel, supported by my generous patrons.
- I can't thank you enough, by the way
- (short Patreon plug)
- But again, my ADHD caught up with me.
- Right when I needed to be self-directed, to decide for myself what to spend each day doing.
- And I found that I had a problem.
- I needed more help.

---

## So how Do We Fix This?

notes:

If it's so simple, can we just take a dopamine supplament and solve this all?

Suprisingly, for mental health, yes, that's almost exactly what you can do.
The medicine is simple, with few side-effects, and if you live in a developed country, available for free.

---

# Adult Diagnosis

notes:

- By this time it was September 2023, there was almost nowhere you could get an ADHD diagnosis, and those that were still accepting patients had multi-year waiting lists.
- After exhaustive research, I found a provider that was still accepting patients. They did this with a clever little hack of being the extremely expensive.
- After sleeping on it, I decided that I could be repaid many times for my investment, and took the plunge.
- The next week I was diagnosed and had medication.

---

# Medication

notes:

Adhd medication is really effective.
If you are being affected by the same dopamine imbalance as affects me.

- They START you on medication for ADHD before much else.
- Which is weird because in other conditions medication is usually the last resort.
    - Try therapy and CBT before antidepressants, for example.
- But ADHD meds are GOOD.

---

# Conclusion and Lessons Learned

---

## Drugs Are Good

caffeine is a drug too!

titration

ADHD stimulants either increases dopamine production, or slow down re-uptake, or both.
methalphenaldate - ritalin - reuptake and stim
lisdexamphetamine - reuptake and stim
adimoxatine - SNRI - nuroadrenalin reuptake inhibitor

- medication holiday to see if you fixed
	- proof that you CAN be efficient

- take them any time you want
STIMULATNS NOT DEPRESSION MEDS
no bad stuff

---

## Deadlines

- Even my personal projects like my episodic sci-fi audio fiction, Lost Terminal, had built-in

---

## Procrastination Monkey
---

## Lists
---

## Checkboxes

japanese train operators
military drivers
checklist manifesto
midwives nurses

---

## Triggers and Habits
---

## Routine
---

## Public Accountability
---

I'd make a title, but I'm already on my 5th hobby today. https://imgur.com/gallery/owmJ2Xm

# Conclusion

- 1994 first conference to discuss gender differences
- sociatal problems
- prison population
- talk to your doctor, I was very fortunate to be able to pay for a quicker diagnosis than many of my friends, but my advice to my last self even I couldn't afford it is the wait is worth it, start the ballrrolling today
- wider sociatal benefit to adhd?
	- bad for the individual, but pehraps good for the whole?
- adhd name is a problem

my dad said don't be a teacher, there's no money in it, be a programmer.
Look at me now.

podcast voice comes form practie
dysfunctionas -> atypical

childhood symptoms are essential to find because otherwise it could be a recent, new condition, and that would be an emergency
