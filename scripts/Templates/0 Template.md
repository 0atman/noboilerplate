# OUTTRO

I used Rust to make a fun retro computer visualisation for my hopepunk podcast, Lost Terminal.

Or if urban fantasy is more your bag, click the bottom video to listen to a strange and beautiful podcast I produce called Modem Prometheus.

Transcripts and compile-checked markdown sourcecode are available on github, links in the description, and corrections are in the pinned ERRATA comment.

Thank you so much for watching, talk to you on Discord.
