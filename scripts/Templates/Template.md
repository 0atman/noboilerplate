# OUTTRO

If you'd like to see what you can write in rust, click the top video: I used it to make a fun retro computer visualisation for my hopepunk podcast, Lost Terminal.

Or if urban fantasy is more your bag, click the bottom video to listen to a strange and beautiful podcast I produce called Modem Prometheus.

If you would like to support my work, head to patreon.com/noboilerplate.
Transcripts and compile-checked markdown sourcecode are available on github, links in the description, and corrections are in the pinned ERRATA comment.

Thank you so much for watching, talk to you on Discord.

```rust
  println!("That's all folks!");
}
