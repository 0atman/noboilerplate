These lints make clippy less noisy when I'm building the video

```rust
#![allow(dead_code, unused_variables)]

```

# Setup

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Rust talk");

# OUTRO

Thank you.

If you would like to support my channel, get early ad-free and tracking-free videos, your name in the credits or 1:1 mentoring, head to my patreon or ko-fi.

If you're interested in transhumanism and hopepunk, please check out my weekly sci-fi audiofiction podcast, Lost Terminal.

Or if urban fantasy is more your bag, do listen to a strange and beautiful podcast I produce every full moon called Modem Prometheus.

Transcripts and compile-checked markdown sourcecode are available on github, links in the description, and corrections are in the pinned ERRATA comment.

Thank you so much for watching, talk to you on Discord.
