# OUTTRO

If you would like to support my channel, get early ad-free and tracking-free videos and vip discord access head to patreon.com/noboilerplate.

If you're interested in transhumanism and hopepunk stories, please check out my sci-fi podcast, Lost Terminal.

Or if urban fantasy is more your bag, click the bottom video to listen to a strange and beautiful podcast I produce called Modem Prometheus.

Transcripts and compile-checked markdown sourcecode are available on github, links in the description, and corrections are in the pinned ERRATA comment.

Thank you so much for watching, talk to you on Discord.

  println!("That's all folks!");
