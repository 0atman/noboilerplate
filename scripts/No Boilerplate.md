Welcome, this is the published source code and [Obsidian vault](https://obsidian.md) for the videos on [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate), No Boilerplate, of fast technical videos.

The latest script is [[36-Linux-Workstations]]

# My Other Projects

If you like sci-fi, check out my hopepunk podcast, Lost Terminal, at https://www.lostterminal.com

If you like urban fantasy, I produce a wonderful podcast called Modem Prometheus: https://www.modemprometheus.com

# Building Instructions

Code for my videos is over at https://github.com/0atman/noboilerplate

I build these using [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and the [advanced-slides plugin](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides): I take each slide, printscreen it, and splice it with my audio using [reaper.fm](http://reaper.fm/).

# Recommended Rust Reading

Here are some great resources that I used to teach myself:

- The Book
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/

- Everything on fasterthanli.me, starting with
https://fasterthanli.me/articles/understanding-rust-futures-by-going-way-too-deep

- Rust By Example (follows the same chapter ordering to The Book)
https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/

- Rustlings code kata, learn by fixing tiny failing tests
https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings

- My video series on Rust (of course!) playlist here, watch RUST-6 first (my recommended set up) and then the rest in any order:

- My Discord server, especially #programming and #newbie-advice. There's a huge community of friendly folks here, answering questions on Rust all day every day. Do tag me and say hi!
