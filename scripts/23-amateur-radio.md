Hi friends my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast, technical videos.

Today I'm going to talk about a new world I've discovered, a world that predated the internet and that will be here after the internet as we know it is gone.

That world is called Amateur Radio.

notes:
There is an invisible society in every city in the world.
Hiding in plain sight.

---
![[berlin-skyline.png]]

notes:
You won't find them online, they don't have an ip address, not on the public internet anyway.

---


![[london-skyline.png]]

notes:

You can some times catch glimpses of this society on rooftops.
If you know what to look for, there is evidence on every street.

---


![[car-radios.png]]

notes:
Or on cars.

---

![[loft-antenna.png]]

notes:

Sometimes the equipment is hidden, either from prying eyes or protected from nature and lightning, but it's there.

---

![[building-antennas-on-roof.png]]

In every city in the world, there are amatuer radio operators.
Millions of us.

![[baofeng.png|700]]

notes:

The price of admission is very low.
$25 on amazon, you can have a simple radio delivered tomorrow.

---

![[cb-radio-car.png]]

notes:

If you've heard of CB radio, and you're thinking oh this sounds similar.
You're getting there, but Amateur radio is so much more.

---

# VHF 144-146MHz
# UHF 430-440MHz

notes:

We'll start with the two most common amateur radio bands, VHF and UHF.

They are simple to start with, only requiring inexpensive radios.
The signals don't tend to go over the horizon, but 

With just these two bands, you can do SO MUCH FUN STUFF.

On this band you can communicate with amateur radio satellites.

# Repeaters

notes:
Cell phones don't have very long range.
In fact, you need towers in every neibourhood to support them.
It's a clever idea, and one that Amateur Radio operators were experimenting with even before the first commercial cell phone in 1983.

There are repeaters EVERYWHERE, no matter where you live.

In decending order of my youtube audience stats, here are the repeater maps for -

# USA

![[usa-repeaters.png]]

notes:

The United States.

# Germany

notes:

# (rest of Europe)

![[eu-repeaters.png]]

notes:
Oh and the rest of Europe obviously.

---

# UK

![[uk-repeaters.png]]

notes:

My home country of the UK has a few.

---

# India
![[india-repeaters.png]]

India.

---

# Canada

![[canada-repeaters.png]]

And Canada.

---


![[global-repeaters.png]]

notes:

You might note that as usual, this kind of map approximates a population map.

Wherever there are towns and cities there are repeaters!

If you want access to this world, it's cheap and easy, but like driving a car, there's a test and a license.
And just like driving a car it augments any outdoor activity you might want to do.

I've not even talked about the lower frequencies, where you can get worldwide propogation without using repeaters!

More on that after I tell you about returning sponsor, Quadratic.

notes:
In fact, because quadratic are using Pyodide inside webassembly, any pure python dependency can be installed, like this example of the faker library.

notes:
Because all of python is running locally inside webassembly, complex work, such as here pulling data from an api, is possible.

ã€‰why would normal people get excited for amateur radio in a world where cell phones are ubiquitous
1. Emergency Communication: Amateur radio operators can communicate in times of natural disasters, emergencies, and other situations where traditional communication methods may fail. During such instances, amateur radio offers an alternative communication method and can potentially save lives.

2. Hobby: Amateur radio operation can be a fun and engaging hobby for people, especially those interested in electronics and communication technologies. Operators can contact people from all over the world, participate in contests, and explore different communication modes.

3. Local Community: Amateur radio clubs can bring together people with shared interests, and foster relationships among local communities. This can lead to social interactions, friendships and a sense of community that is not possible with cell phone use.

4. Exploration and Innovation: Amateur radio operators can experiment and come up with new ways of communication, modes of transmission, and receive certification for their achievements.

5. Low Cost: While cell phones require paid subscriptions, amateur radio only requires a very low amount of money for equipment purchase, and no ongoing fees.

In conclusion, while cell phones have become ubiquitous and offer instant communication, amateur radio provides a distinct offering for those interested in communication as a hobby, emergency communications, or seeking a unique social alternative to using cell phones.

|        |                  |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| 2.4GHz | WiFi & Bluetooth |
| 27MHz  | CB Radio         |
| ?      | Amateur Radio?   |


notes:
You might have seen something like this in a science textbook at some point.

Low frequency radio on the left, high frequency radio on the right.

The frequency you'll be most familiar with is 2.4GHz, which is what both WiFi and Bluetooth run on.

CB radio operates at about 27MHz, at the bottom of the VHF band.
CB is much better in an urban environment than WiFi, and can travel up to about 4km.

Where does Amateur radio operate? 

EVERYWHERE
