# 2E1OAT
(that's my radio callsign!)

notes:

Hi friends my name is Tris 2E1OAT and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast, technical videos.

Today I'm going to talk about a whole world I've discovered, a world that predated the internet and that will be here after the internet as we know it is gone.

That world is called Amateur Radio.

notes:
You might have seen something like this in a science textbook at some point.

Low frequency radio on the left, high frequency radio on the right.

The frequency you'll be most familiar with is 2.4GHz, which is what both WiFi and Bluetooth run on, for the most part.

CB radio operates at about 27MHz, at the top of the HF band.
CB is much better in an urban environment than WiFi, and can travel up to about 4km.

Where does Amateur radio operate? 

EVERYWHERE

notes:

Anyone can listen to any frequency - shortwave radio listening or even aircraft and marine listening is just a radio purchase away.
The radio waves were inside your house already, after all!
But if you want to transmit, you must have a license.

License procedures vary from country to country, but certainly in the UK and US the barrier to entry is very low.
You do not need to know morse code or understand complex radio jargon.
For the foundation exam in the UK I did just an hour of study, and then completed the exam entirely online in half an hour.

License restrictions vary slightly from country to country, but because it is by definition a global hobby, they are broadly aligned across the world.

![[january_2016_spectrum_wall_chart.jpg]]

notes:

Amateur radio is one of the great commons of our society, and it is nothing short of a miracle that we have them for our use.

Here is a graph of the whole frequency spectrum, from 0Hz all the way up to 300GHz.

This is the license space in the US, but it's about the same in every country - you can listen to any band, but you can't transmit.
The airwaves are cut up and divided.
Just like land use, someone owns it, or in this case, is licensing it from the government.
TV, Broadcast radio, military, and lots and lots of commercial areas.
You can use it, but you have to pay. Millions of dollars a year, in licensing fees, to the government.

There's no free space. Even the unlicensed areas you might have heard of, wifi, bluetooth, lora, CB and so on, are tiny slices of the airwaves with strict transmit power and antenna size limitations.

There's no free areas. except the Amateur Radio bands.

---

![[ham-january_2016_spectrum_wall_chart.jpg]]

notes:
Let me colour in the ham bands for you to make it clear.
They're EVERYWHERE, little slices of every single section, from low-frequency all the way up to microwave.

these areas aren't free to use, it's better than that, they are PROTECTED.

---

# Licence restrictions

1. No commercial use
2. No encryption
3. No broadcasting
4. Transmitter and receivers must be licensed. 

notes:

they are protected by the Amateur Radio License.

Broadly speaking here are the core limits of the amateur radio bands.

These restrictions prevent the tragedy of the commons occurring on our airwaves.

---

| Closed Source    | Open Source   |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| WiFi & Bluetooth | Amateur Radio |

notes:

You can think of this as the distinction between closed source software and Open Source software.

Amateur radio, because it can not be encrypted, can be analysed 
it's source, so to speak, is open.
If an amateur invents a new encoding method that uses less bandwidth or is higher quality (as happens all the time!) anyone listening can hear it and figure it out.

The primary activities on the ham bands are learning, experimentation, and teaching.

---

# Code vs Encryption

notes:

Morse code is an encoding of data.
It's allowed on the ham bands because it's not designed to hide information, and even though most people don't know morse code, it's freely understandable by anyone who wants to learn.

SSL, RSA, even Enigma cyphers are all designed to hide information.
They are not allowed on the ham bands.

If you want to tunnel HTTP traffic through the amateur bands, you can, but you can't use SSL.

_(thanks @laund on discord for this awesome graphic!)_

notes:
BTW
I didn't think I'd ever be interested in Morse Code.
I'm delighted the basic exams don't require it any more.
But now that I understand a bit about how radio works, I see that the reason we're still using Morse, 186 years later, is because it's a really efficient use of the radio power.

I don't have time to explain in this short video, but for weak signal propagation between two humans, Morse can out-perform nearly every fancy computer-generated mode we have.
All without a microprocessor.

After the apocalypse, I want to know a Morse operator.
Or I suppose, before the apocalypse I SHOULD LEARN MORSE.

Let's talk about the apocalypse a little more.

notes:

ARES RAYNET

the first thing that goes down in an emergency is the cell phone system.
Either through damage or congestion.

This is something that amateur radio clubs practice for.
When there is a disaster, perhaps an earthquake, hams are ready to spring into action, and set up field bases in the disaster site.
They then coordinate with hams back at the hospitals or wherever, to bridge the communications gap.

For example, they are currently helping the humanitarian effort in Ukraine.

The two organisations I am aware of are ARES in the US, and RAYNET here in the UK.

But your country will have something similar too.


But what if you live in a city, with all the buildings in the way?

![[repeater-on-mountain.png]]

notes:

To get your hand-held radio's signal across town, or over a hill you might need a repeater.

Cell phones don't have very long range.
In fact, you need towers in every neighbourhood to support them.
It's a clever idea, and one that Amateur Radio operators were experimenting with even before the first commercial cell phone in 1983.

There are repeaters EVERYWHERE, no matter where you live.

In descending order of my youtube audience , here are the repeater maps for -

![[global-repeaters.png]]

notes:

You might note that as usual, this kind of map approximates a population map.

Wherever there are towns and cities there are repeaters!

If you want access to this world, it's cheap and easy, but like driving a car, there's a test and a license.
And just like driving a car it augments any outdoor activity you might want to do.

I've not even talked about the lower frequencies, where you can get worldwide propagation without using repeaters!

![[qrz-tris.png]]

notes:

We even have our own 90s style social network that is so early-myspace-looking I'm surprised Tom hasn't started litigation.
this is qrz.com, the most popular ham log book site.
The name qrz comes from Q codes, which are short control codes originally used by Morse telegraph operators.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_code#Amateur_radio
QRZ means "Who is calling me?"

Everyone, including me, as you see, registers so you can log your contacts, which is an important part of the hobby, because you can't know if you're being heard unless someone tells you!

---

![[prop-report.jpg]]

notes:
There are a few people who set up automated propagation reports for some digital modes of operation.
Here's my report for a day last September when I was testing out my new antenna, for example.

Because I got these reports back, I can be reasonably sure my antenna was set up correctly

notes:

# Personal communications

When you talk to someone on radio without a repeater, you are talking directly to them at the speed of light, from your microphone to their speaker, with no intermediaries.
Using the right frequency and antenna, this can be local in your city, or transcontinental, bouncing off the atmosphere or ground.

This direct communication feels much more personal - your voice is being mixed with a radio carrier signal or similar and broadcast in an analogue signal, then the receiver reverses the process to demodulate your voice.

It's analogue all the way, no bits, no bytes.

Isn't that wonderful?

# VHF 144-146MHz
# UHF 430-440MHz

notes:

We'll start with the two most common amateur radio bands, VHF and UHF.

They are simple to start with, only requiring inexpensive radios.
The signals don't tend to go over the horizon, but 

With just these two bands, you can do SO MUCH FUN STUFF.
