notes:

This time we want to focus on user signups, so walking through the high-level features again and show a simple example.

![[quadratic-formula-python-selection.png|700]]

notes:

Quadratic combines the functional data visualisation of a spreadsheet with power programming languages, starting with Python, the standard in data science.

<!-- slide bg="rgb(37, 34, 43)" -->
notes:
Using Pyodide inside webassembly, any pure python dependency can be installed, and a few non-pure packages like nummpy and pandas that have been ported from C++.

---

<!-- slide bg="rgb(37, 34, 43)" -->

![[quadratic-api-demo.png]]

notes:
Because all of python is running locally inside webassembly, complex work, such as here pulling data from an api, is possible.

![[quadratic-fps.png]]


notes:


This is all running at 60fps using webgl, with smooth scrolling and pinch to zoom.
All inside your browser.

![[Quadratic Logo.png]]

notes:

- Quadratic are building an Open Source spreadsheet for engineers and data scientists, built in Rust, Webassembly and WebGL

---

<!-- slide bg="rgb(37, 34, 43)" -->
![[quadratic choose cell type.png]]
notes:

- This might be the coolest spreadsheet I've ever used, and I've used emacs!
- You can choose your formula language,
  - Either simple excel-style statements, or
  - SQL and Python, both standards in the field of Data Science
- Because all data is evaluated in Webassembly, Quadratic is fast
- The UI is in WebGL, with hardware acceleration in all modern browsers, allowing 60fps scrolling, complex graphics, and smooth pinch-to-zoom

This is a really exciting project that I'm delighted to say is hiring.

notes:

Quadratic are looking for:
- Rust developers for their rewrite (the existing code is in typescript)
- People with WebGL experience, even if that's only with JavaScript
- People with Apache Arrow experience for processing Quadratic's high-performance datasets, and,
- Senior engineers used to working at the pace of a startup.

My thanks to Quadratic for their support of this channel.

Let's look at another example of a large-scale webgl app that hasn't paid me to talk about them.
