Hi friends my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast, technical videos.

Let me take you back to April 2020.

It is 3:30am, I have just woken up from my core sleep of 4h 30mins, and I feel fantastic. It will be 5 hours before I need to start work at my day job, and I feel like I have unlocked an extra day's worth of productive free time, accessed through my practice of Polyphasic sleep. 

But how did I get here?

## Early Experiments

Monophasic = one sleep in 24h
Biphasic = two sleeps in 24h (ie, having a siesta)(Such as the Spanish siesta. This is called _biphasic_, two phases of sleep, one at night, one during the day.")

notes:

In 2007 I learned about Polyphasic sleep, which is the largely-untested hypothesis that if you sleep more often during a 24-hour cycle, you need less overall sleep than if you just slept once. We observe that cultures who have a midday sleep  tend to require less overall sleep than cultures with one block of nighttime sleep

---

The cited examples in support of the polyphasic hypothesis include cross-Atlantic sailors sleeping in short bursts, military personnel on watch, parents of newborn babies, and Buckminster Fuller's famous _"twenty-two thinking hours a day"_.{% sidenote 'dymaxion' "The Dymaxion schedule: 30 minutes nap every 6 hours." %}

---

The method I tried in 2007 is the _Uberman_ schedule. This method is simple: Take a 20-minute nap every 4 hours. No other sleep. 
{% marginfigure "uberman" "http://thumb.napchart.com:1771/api/getImage?width=600&height=600&chartid=gd3dk" "The Uberman Schedule." %}

This is the most talked-about schedule in Polyphasic circles because of the tantalising potential to achieve Fuller-levels of waking time. In Uberman, you take a 20-minute nap at 12, 4 and 8 - both AM and PM. This (and Dymaxion) is the most extreme polyphasic sleep schedule, and the one that requires the least actual sleep - 2 hours in every 24!

---

Where does this 2 hours come from? It comes from the observation that we only have about two hours of REM, of dreaming, in every night of sleep. The polyphasers hypothesise that itâ€™s only the REM phase that is useful for the brain{% sidenote 'trickuberman' "The trick with Uberman is to get the brain to drop into REM, to dream, for the whole of the 20 minute nap. That is a hell of a trick." %}, the rest of the time is spent in deep sleep. Deep sleep is restful for the body, but no more so than waking forms of rest.

---

Back to Uberman: My brother and I tried it for a week, it was MISERABLE and I crashed out HARD. "He stuck with it for about another week." The problem with Uberman is its brutal adaptation period: You basically don't nap the first few days, because you're not used to sleeping during the day, and this means you're immediately sleep deprived. It takes two weeks for your brain to start squeezing in REM into your naps, to avoid permanent damage.Record-breaking sleepers seldom can stay awake for [longer than a week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation)." 

---

> "my business associates [...] insisted on sleeping like other men"

notes:

The second problem, which also caused Buckminster Fuller to fall back to monophasic sleeping, is how society is rigidly built around sleeping at nighttime.

Thus disillusioned with Polyphasic sleep, I forgot about it for a decade.

# Part 2
## My History With Sleep
pumpkin.jpg

I've had fairly standard sleep experience in life: Though a 3am bedtime was perfectly normal at university, that's unthinkable now that I've had 15 years of 7am alarms for work. I have always needed lots of sleep: My friends joke that once the clock gets past 11pm, I'm at risk of turning into a pumpkin.

I'd always been a light sleeper, but in 2017 I developed mild insomnia, adding the inability to fall asleep to my already-impressive inability to **stay** asleep. Ugh! Despite being in bed before 11pm, I'd only fall asleep between 1-2am. This then put pressure on my wake-up time in the morning, making me groggy, late for work, and feeling like I was wasting the day.

---

## Covid-19
(OH GREAT)

Many times during the past decade, I've thought about trying Polyphasic sleeping again Especially as a way to overhaul my dysfunctional sleep schedule, but my plans were always tempered by Fuller's experience that you have to live in a society of offices, trains, evening get-togethers, and constant interruptions. 

Perhaps you can see where this is going. When I started polyphasing, I was 44 days into the Covid lockdown here in London. I'd been very fortunate to be able to work from home, and because much of my socialising is digital anyway, things were going as well as could be hoped for.

On the 10th of April 2020, we had a long weekend of two national holidays and I realised that the stars had aligned for a polyphasic experiment: Not only did I no longer live in a world of offices and the forced exodus of commuting, I had 4 days where I wasn't even expected to be webcam-present at my work.

---

That day, I had come across [polyphasic.net](http://polyphasic.net). I was going to try Uberman again, indeed that search led me to the site, but they categorise it as _"VERY HARD"_ and _"NOT RECOMMENDED"_ and go as far as saying that only people with a genetic predisposition can do it!{% marginfigure "everyman" "http://thumb.napchart.com:1771/api/getImage?width=600&height=600&chartid=9zmeq" "My Everyman 2 Schedule." %}
Also, they found 0% success rate, based on trawling reddit data. They couldn't find a single account of someone sticking with it. They recommended a much more successful schedule: Everyman.

---


| Schedule          | Total Sleep | Core Sleep |
| :---------------- | ----:       | -----:     |
| Everyman 1        | 6h 20m      | 6h 0m      |
| Everyman 2        | 5h 10m      | 4h 30m     |
| Everyman 3        | 4h 0m       | 3h 0m      |

notes:


Reading the excellent guide on the Everyman sleep schedule (at [polyphasic.net/schedules/everyman/](https://polyphasic.net/schedules/everyman/)), I realised this was much more approachable. There are three variants of Everyman, E1, E2, E3. They are numbered based on how many naps you have during the day. They represent a gradient between efficiency and easy-of-adaptation. E1 is effectively a siesta schedule, and E3 requires only double Uberman's sleep total. I resolved to try Everyman 2 (E2): 

After a late-night explanation to my partner{% sidenote 'partner' "She has the patience of a saint." %}, I set a silent alarm on my watch to 3am, and began the experiment!

# Part 3
## Easter Adaptation


What a dream the adaptation was! The first 24h of any polyphasic experiment are always best: Even if you can't hack it, your sleep debt won't catch up to you on the first day, and you'll feel like you're breaking out of a stupid societal default. It's very profound to be pulling an all-nighter with the knowledge that this isn't a one-off, and these are hours that will be permanently available to you, rather than being borrowed from the next day.

Compared to my memory of the constant-sleepiness of Uberman, Everyman 2 was so much easier, even right at the start. I certainly felt tired, and during the first few days I had to keep busy and be aware that to lie down was to risk sleeping (which would have ruined adaptation). But by the 4th day, back at work, I had basically transitioned. 



It's been a month since I started waking up at 3am{% marginfigure "everyman" "https://i.imgur.com/xVVXNAf.png" "My Everyman 2 Schedule." %} and taking two naps during the day, as detailed in [my previous post](/articles/20/sleep-experiment) in this series.

I'm still keeping up my practice. I'm still overjoyed at the extra day's-worth of free time it gives me, early in the morning, when there is nothing pressing to do. This time is truly my own.

Though I have moments of tiredness now and then, they're diminishing every day, and it was a very small price to pay for getting 5 hours of productive time in the morning before I have to start work. For example, last Thursday, I arranged a cover of [Tangerine Dream's _Love On A Real Train_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1meeqQRR28), and published it to YouTube the next day, all work done before sunrise:

# Timeline

## 10/04/20
I woke up at 3:00 and hit Everyman 2 cold turkey. I didn't prepare in advance, other than setting a silent alarm on my watch. My routine is to get up, shower, and sit in front of my computer. During this first weekend, I knew I'd need to have strategies to keep myself awake, so I mostly played video games{% sidenote 'fo76' "Fallout 76, mostly." %} during this time. I think this worked well, as it didn't require much brainpower (which I was lacking in the first weekend), but kept me awake through the adaptation period.

## 14/04/20
First day at work after the long weekend's adaptation. I had no problem getting back to it. My tiredness was now much reduced, and I was in no danger of falling asleep while working! (I have never fallen asleep during times I'd not scheduled a nap, though I occasionally nap for an extra 10 minutes).

My first nap at 7:00 and second at 13:00 fits well into my work schedule. The first doesn't affect my 8am start time, and the second I take during my lunchbreak.

Everyman 2 is flexible enough that I've moved my afternoon nap +/- 1h without much difficulty. I do note that I feel a little tiredness the next day if I move it a lot.

## 20/04/20
    
2 weeks in, I feel 90%{% sidenote 'ish' "Or thereabouts." %} adapted, and have survived missing a nap, poor sleep quality due to sickness, and the constant clamour of people telling me that this is a bad idea. Nothing can persuade me to go back now, but I'm confident that if I need to break routine (say, for a holiday), I can easily pick it up again.
{% marginfigure 'asym' "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Hyperbola_one_over_x.svg/1024px-Hyperbola_one_over_x.svg.png" "It seems to take a long time to get back to 100%" %}
## 10/05/20
 

That brings us to today. I feel 95% adapted, and slowly, day by day, asymptotically approaching 100%.

# Life Changes

## Insomnia

As I mentioned in my [previous post](/articles/20/sleep-experiment), I used to have insomnia. I'd be in bed before 23:00, but not asleep before 1:00. As I hoped, the upheaval of Everyman 2 has cured me of this. I'm really good at sleeping now!

## Bedtime Strictness

The other side of the _being-cured-of-insomnia_ coin is that I'm VERY tired at the end of the day: After 21:30 I'm falling asleep, and am ready to drop at 22:00.

While I understand this is quite normal for early-birds, it's a novel experience for me!

## Social Life Impact

My tiredness at the end of the day means that I'm keen to wind up social gatherings before 22:00. Though this isn't much different to how I was before, I'm now completely disciplined about logging off at 22:00.



## Partner Impact?

Lucy's been very accommodating to my new schedule. I built my timetable to suit her, to minimise disruption. This is easy, as she sleeps soundly, I often don't wake her when getting up at 3:00.

## Health Changes

As with many Polyphasic experiments, I've found that my caffeine and calorie consumption has gone up dramatically. These two tools are very useful for waking yourself up in the adaptation period. I am now making a conscious effort to cut both down to the previous norms, as would be more healthy. I've gained about 3KG, and it'll be difficult to lose that. However, assuming I can get that under control, it'll have been a worthwhile step.

<br/>
<br/>

# Advice For The Curious

## Well-Meaning Friends & Family

Many things have surprised me during this experiment. The biggest one has been that about half the people I talk to ABSOLUTELY HATE it:

> "I don't think it is a good idea. In fact, it might be construed as heuristic to the point of being selfish"{% sidenote 'dad' "Oatpa" %}

This is a very typical attitude. Sleep is a topic similar to diet and exercise - everyone has an opinion because we're all familiar with the subject matter.

My advice is to experiment quietly, telling only those around you that you need to nap during the day. You'll either succeed or fail, and both will be a valuable learning experience. You can then confidently _come out_ in a big way!{% sidenote 'comeout' "By writing the longest blog post of your life, for instance." %} I'm reminded of one of the rules of the Cult Of Done{% sidenote 'cod' "<https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13>" %} that states:

> Those without dirty hands are wrong.

<br/>
<br/>

## Things That Helped Me During Adaptation 

Pick your schedule (Everyman{% sidenote 'everypoly' "[polyphasic.net/schedules/everyman/](https://polyphasic.net/schedules/everyman/)" %} works well, with 3 different options to suit your schedule).
 
Listening to brown noise while napping, if you are a light sleeper{% sidenote 'brown' "[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6MemVxEquE&t=31825s) is my favourite. Mmm, brown flavour." %}.
 
Start on a weekend you can isolate yourself from obligations.
 
Programme some low-effort distractions for the first few days, and don't worry that you're not productive; that'll come.

Don't eat breakfast at night. I found after a week of NEEDING to eat to stay awake, I preferred to wait until after my first nap to have breakfast. My digestion seemed slow and uncomfortable at night{% sidenote 'circadian' "Something something circadian rhythm." %}.

I found that having meals after each nap (breakfast and lunch, respectively), washing my face, and having a drink of water, really helped me bounce back into wakefulness. 

If you are able to get blackout curtains or blinds for your bedroom, that's a great way of helping you nap.
