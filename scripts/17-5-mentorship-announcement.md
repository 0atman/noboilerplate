# Coding, writing, and production mentoring

notes:

Hi friends my name is Tris and this is a very special announcement that I'm going to start offering mentorship, education, and project advice either via Patreon or a-la-carte

I have been spending every free moment working on the channel since my first video in April of last year, and I have decided to make No Boilerplate my full time job.

That means I am offering what I am good at to you folks:

- Mentoring on Rust, 
- programming, 
- your projects, 
- web tech, 
- computer science, 
- audio or video production 
- anything from my wide area of expertise, I can teach.

If you want you can join one of the new Patreon tiers that offer regular mentoring. Check out patreon.com/noboilerplate for details on each tier.

Reach out and we'll talk about what's good for you, check noboilerplate.org for contact details.

Let's talk in more detail about mentoring.

I have been coding and producing audio and video for a long time. Everything you see and hear on my channel I can teach you.

- Would you like to get up to speed with Rust quickly?
I can help with that

- Would you like to know how to record and master audio, both vocal and music?
I can help with that, too

- Would you like to know how to write a video script, podcast script, or other creative writing?
I can help with that too, I write scripts every single day.

The calls will be on video chat and you can book one month in advance. We can build a custom collaboration platform on github, which is another thing I can teach you how to use.

I'm so excited about this, I love teaching and breaking down problems into simple explanations as you may have noticed.

I'm at at point in my life where I'd like to focus on education.

All of these plans are entirely new for me, and is my attempt at turning No Boilerplate from my hobby into my profession.

I have never been so excited about a project, and I can't wait to get started.

That's the announcement, thank you for your time, check out the description for links, and I'll perhaps see you in a mentoring session, talking about your next project.

My name is Tris, and this is No Boilerplate. Let's build something together.
