- Tris explains his wierd habits

notes:
Welcome to another episode of Tris Explains His Weird Habits, I guess.

---

# Part 1: A Love-letter to Meals

---

- Soylent (which is the generic name for the powdered food I’ve been eating)

---

- Food production needs to change

---

- We see this in the news all the time, including in this article from The Tab which called me up for an interview

---

- We’re running out of space for traditional farming methods

---

- In many parts of the world, they’ve ALREADY run out of space due to climate change and population growth

---

- Soylent, and those like it aim to solve some of this problem. I talk about Soylent and the other powdered foods interchangeably, but soylent was the OG

---

- Though Soylent was the first to market, and has the biggest goals, there are many others

---

- Jimmy Joy is my favourite of the competitors. Dutch

---

- But there’s Huel (human fuel), English

---

- And Queal (quick meal) Dutch

---

- Here are Jimmy Joy’s main ingredients

---

But they change depending on what is available to each country

---

Fishoil problem, solved by Soylent

---

- Soylent has Algal in, nutritionally-dense fats derived from algae

---

- Algal is very interesting, requiring only sunlight and water to farm

---

- The vats can be self-contained, with no contact to the air. You could grow these on mars.

---

- Vertical farming could be used back here on earth

---

- You could even deorbit a shipping container of Soylent powder to a disaster area, where there is little-to-no infrastructure, and, as long as they have water (which is concern #1), the communitity can eat for weeks.

---

- Soylent might not be the future of food, but the future will look something like soylent.
