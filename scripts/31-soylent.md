Hi friends my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast, technical videos.

# Tris Explains His Weird Habits

notes:
Welcome to another episode of _"Tris Explains His Weird Habits"_, I guess.

Most of my meals are meal replacements, nutritionally complete drinks or instant meals, and they have been for the last 10 years.

These tools are incredible for a lot of reasons, from convenience to health to price.

I have tips and recommendations to figure out if you should look at integrating these tools into your life, and also what brands work for me.

I want to make one thing clear first: I don't hate cooking, in fact, quite the opposite.

# Part 1: A Love-letter to Meals

notes:

I LOVE cooking.
Food is turned into a meal by this magical process.

Animals eat food, plants eat food, even bacteria eat food.

We're different.
Humans make meals.

---

_"The Matrix" (1999)_

notes:

This is one of the many ways we are different to animals.
There's something primally human about cooking food for those you love, then enjoying eating it together.

If it's just about sustenance, and not pleasure, it's not a meal, it's just food.

> "I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; **but I will not eat with you**,
drink with you, nor pray with you."

&mdash; Shylock from _The Merchant of Venice_

notes:

The act of eating at the same table as someone is raised to the highest form of social intimacy, and I think with good reason.

---

> Humanism is a philosophical stance that emphasizes the individual and social potential, and agency of human beings, whom it considers the starting point for serious moral and philosophical inquiry.

&mdash; Wikipedia

notes:

I consider myself a Humanist - I relish in the things we as humans do differently from the rest of the animal kingdom:
- Birds sing, but humans write music
- Animals leave the weak behind, but humans nurse them back to health
- Horses can gallop for a while, but humans run all day and into the night

I'm very impressed by us, as a species.

I started running for exercise a few years ago when I read that humans are the best long-distance runners on the planet.
Give us enough time, and we'll make a meal out of that fast gazelle.

## I Don't Hate Cooking

# I Love it

notes:

This whole preface is to impress upon you that I am not replacing some meals in my life because I'm lazy, don't like cooking, or don't care what I eat.

I do it because sometimes it's better.

---

# Part 2

## What Are Meal Replacements?

notes:

I first became aware of the category of food called meal replacements, as many of you likely were, when the Soylent company started, in 2013.

The whole concept intrigued me, a quick meal that was cheap and nutritionally complete.

Finally, the world of tomorrow that Futurama promised me was here!

![[soylent-green-conveyor.png]]

_"Soylent Green" (1973)_

notes:
And to get the joke out of the way, no Soylent isn't made OF people, but it is made FOR people, unlike in the Charlton Heston movie.

Back in 2013 I was frustrated, as, living in the UK, I could not get Soylent's powdered drinks shipped here to try.

---

![[completefoods-website-people-chow.png]]

<https://completefoods.co>

notes:

All was not lost, as the soylent company, true to their silicon valley roots, set up a community website, which used to be diysoylent, and now is completefoods.co, for those of us who couldn't get their hands on the real deal, either through backordering or shipping limitations.

I tried a few recipes and was astonished at the results.

# Not Feeling Hungry

## !=

# Feeling Full

notes:

I discovered, for the first time in my high-calorie life, that I didn't need to feel like I had a full stomach to stop feeling hungry.

This might be obvious in hindsight, but at the time I was astonished at this disparity.

In all my life leading up to this point, I associated a full stomach with the cessation of hunger.

![[tris-kitchen-soylent.jpg|700]]

My kitchen c. 2014

notes:

But here it was, with a single glass of this weird thick, bready drink, I had turned off hunger, but I did not feel full.

And I continued to not feel hungry for hours afterwards.

Something fundamental changed for me that day, and I am making this video to share with you everything I know from this decade long experiment.

notes:

I will talk about Soylent throughout this video, but there are many companies now doing the same or better, especially if you're not based in the US or Canada, you'll want to try a local company:
- JimmyJoy and Queal are based in the Netherlands
- Huel is based in the UK, and actually is sold in some supermarkets here!

It's as good a time as any to say that I am not sponsored by any of them, though I have my own favourites, which I'll go into later on in the video.

My channel is supported by viewers like you.

Thanks to everyone for supporting me on this wild adventure.

Let's talk about what is IN Soylent, or foods that are like it.

---

![[what-is-huel-made-of.jpg]]

<https://huel.com>

notes:

They mostly all contain the same sorts of ingredients, with a few tweaks here and there:

The bulk of meal replacements, regardless of brand, are mostly some kind of high carbohydrate flour, perhaps wheat or oat.
Then some high protein flour, perhaps soya, and then some oil for fat content, and some amount of vitamins and other nutrients.

# Part 3

# Who Is This For?

---

![[soylent-fast-cheap-healthy-venn.svg]]

notes:

Here's three things I'd like to focus on in this section:
- Fast meals
- Cheap meals
- Healthy meals

Notice how "tasty" does not feature here, and that's because all of these categories can be tasty, and it's a very individual preference.
Personally, I love a nice pizza, though it's bad for me and expensive.
I love a rainbow salad, even though it's expensive and slow to make.
And as a Brit I am legally required to love fish and chips, grease and all.

Soylent, meal replacements, are the best of all three of these categories.

---

![[soylen-cacao-pouring.png]]

notes:

They're not so delicious that you risk binging, and not so bad you go out to the shops in search of something tastier.

For me, it's a staple food, one I always have ready in the cupboard, like a slice of bread, or pasta, or a bowl of rice.
They often last for a year before opening, and don't require refrigeration, I'm never out of food.

I'm not excited to drink it, nor do I dread it like some kind of diet food.

It's a tool to press pause on hunger.

notes:

But why not a sandwich? They can be fast, cheap and fairly healthy! a great option, surely?

You're not going to be eating a lovely deli sandwich, or home made sandwich like in these photos.
Deli sandwiches are expensive, home made either takes too long or doesn't have a full range of nutrients.

You've only got a short amount of time, right?
That's why you're making a sandwich.

---

![[tesco-sammich.png]]

notes:

This is the kind of sandwich that qualifies for fast, cheap, and only partially healthy - a supermarket sandwich, for most people, most of the time.

This is the kind of meal I replace. Bullshit meals you're just eating to keep yourself going, keeping the wolf from the door, a quick meal while you are working, or looking after the kids, or on hour 12 of your gaming marathon.

So with this in mind, who could find use for Soylent?

---

# 1.Parents

notes:

Especially single parents or the primary caregiver, while their partner is working.

Healthy, cheap, fast, food.
Parents all too often give the healthiest food to their kids, and they'll then have a quick sandwich after putting the kids to bed, or sadly, go without.

I'm not saying feed your kids Soylent, I'm saying feed *yourself* a complete meal while continuing to do the best for them.

---

# 2.Students

notes:

Long study sessions, or long gaming sessions on a budget require fast, cheap, food.
Students have the reputation of eating anything, or nothing, certainly my friends and I were like that - save your money on takeaway food and spend it on better things.

---

# 3.Environmentalists

notes:

The last point is something I'd not considered until recently.
Food production needs to change.

---

![[farmer-climage-change.png]]

notes:

- We see troubling news all the time
- and it's going to get worse before it gets better
- We're running out of space for traditional farming methods
- In many parts of the world, they've ALREADY run out of space due to climate change and population shifts

- Soylent, and those like it, can solve some of this problem.

notes:

- Soylent, for example, has Algal fats in, nutritionally-dense fats derived from algae
- Algal is very interesting, requiring only sunlight and water to farm
- The vats can be self-contained, with no contact to the air. You could grow these on the Moon, or on Mars.

- Vertical farming can be used back here on earth

---

![[shipping-container-vector.png|600]]

1. De-orbit an ISO 668 container full of Soylent
2. Provide local water
3. ~~profit~~ eat!

notes:

- You could even de-orbit a shipping container of Soylent powder to a disaster area, where there is little-to-no infrastructure, and, as long as they have water (which is concern #1), the community can eat for weeks.

# Part 4

# My Favs

![[plenny-shake-pour.png]]

<https://jimmyjoy.com/collections/plenny-shakes>

notes:

The best tasting of the shakes is the OG Soylent, however I can't get that, the next best tasting is Plenny Shake, from jimmyjoy.com.

The cheapest way to buy it, is in powder, but you can also buy it ready-made, if you are happy to pay for Dutch water!

My favourite is Plenny Shake chocolate.

---

![[huel-hotnsavoury.png]]

<https://uk.huel.com/products/huel-hot-savoury>

notes:

Not every meal replacement is a drink, most of the companies also produce noodles or pasta or rice dishes, the bulk of the carbohydrates in these are pasta or rice, not just flour.

My favourite of these by a LONG way is Huel's mac n cheese, which is straight-up DELICIOUS!

---

![[tris-photo-plenny-duck.png]]

Enjoy!

notes:
in summary:
- Don't replace EVERY meal
- Replace the bad, compromised meals
	- (Breakfast and Lunch usually for me)
- Talk to your doctor if you have dietary concerns
- Enjoy!
