# Slack is Poison

Now I'm really going to make friends with my popular opinions.
I hate slack for work.
I think everyone does.
I hate Microsoft Teams, and Facebook enterprise, and even Discord, specifically for organising work.

All traditional chat apps are a nightmare fire of overlapping conversations scrolling off the top of the screen into the pit of hell slack keeps old messages.

You'll never find them again.

## Next.js GH Discussions

notes:

GitHub comes to the rescue with Discussions, sane threaded asynchronous forums.
Accessed and scoped with your normal organisation GitHub account.

Discussions are the minimum viable forum:
- posts, with replies, and threaded conversation on each reply. No further recursion.

# Socialising

# Is Important

notes:
A corollary to all this is that you SHOULD have a way for your team to socialise.
You don't need to do anything other than document what your team set up.
They might create a chat group, or a discord server, an IRC bot, or World of Warcraft guild.
They might even set up their own slack.
These tools are great for chatting, and they can be used for this purpose.

# Slack Feels like a Never-ending

# All-hands Meeting

notes:
Training is required to reach this level of nirvana.
The open source world was built on async communications.
Primarily mailing lists and forums.
And while IRC and slack and discord are used today, they are still not the primary nexus of communication.
Unfortunately, this is not the standard in businesses and startups.

## Async Discussions Are Not _Natural_ but They Are _Simple_

notes:

Async communication is simple, but it's not natural.
You and your team will have to work on using these tools well, investing in training, and advertising your team as an asynchronous one right in the job spec.

Many people flourish in such an environment and will seek you out. Others will need teaching.
