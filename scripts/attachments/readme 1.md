These are the scripts for my fast technical videos.

Slides are separated with `---` and notes are deliniated with `notes:`.

I present them with the Advanced Slides plugin in Obsidian.md, which are broadly reveal.js compatible. 

For videos after 9, code inside the markdown can be built, and therefore tested, using the makefile in this folder.

Prior to video 9 I hadn't got the exact format sorted out, apologies. 9 and onward should build reliably.

For videos after 16, I moved to using `just` instead of `make`. Install using `cargo install just`
