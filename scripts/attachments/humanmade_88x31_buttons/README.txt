Here is a libresprite project for some 88x31 buttons to add to your retro sites.[^1] 88x31 buttons are a long standing tradition going back to the 90s. They were originally (and still are) used to advertise things you like/endorse/support on your own personal websites. Many people used to host these websites on GeoCities and nowadays you can find many similarly styled ones on neocities (the spiritual successor). The standard of 88px by 31px helps them to all fit together without scaling, but the small size means that anything you'd like to display has to be in the form of pixel art. In this folder are some buttons with a pure black, pure white and windows95esque grey backgrounds (many similar buttons have this background as they were imitating the buttons available in the OS). for the "HumanMade" mark to the absence the lack of AI generated content on the page.[^4]

There is a (unfinished) Wikipedia article on the subject [Web Badge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_badge),[^2] as well as many people's archives of buttons at [hellnet.work/8831](https://hellnet.work/8831/) (this one has over 2500 buttons!).[^3]
