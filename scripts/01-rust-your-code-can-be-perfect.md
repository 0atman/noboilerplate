## Your code
## can be perfect

notes:
Hi friends my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast, technical videos.
This is my re-upload of this video, with many fixes and corrections.

As developers we build critical infrastructure,
it's time to build it in a language designed to build critical infrastructure.

How often have you seen this kind of code?

```python
int(item["ViewCount"]["N"])
```

What problems are there here?

notes:
How often have you seen this kind of code?
What problems might there be here?
The biggest problem is that this line will page you at 4am.

---

```python
int(item["ViewCount"]["N"])
```

1.  The `item` is a `hashmap`,
2.  There is a `ViewCount` attribute,
3.  The `ViewCount` attribute is a `hashmap`,
4.  There is an `N` attribute in the `ViewCount` hashmap, and
5.  The value can be parsed as an integer with `int()`.

notes:
Unsafe assumptions crash our programs at runtime and wake us up at 4am.

---


```rust
i32::from_str_radix(
    item["ViewCount"].unwrap()
        .get("N").unwrap(),
    10
).unwrap()
```

Note the `unwrap()s`.

notes:
This is exactly as unsafe as the Python solution, but the three places it can crash are now explicitly stated.
If you want it to never crash, you find alternatives for those .unwrap()s

Here's a verbose version of what that might look like

---

A verbose rust solution

```
if let Some(view_count_attr) = item.get("ViewCount") {
    match view_count_attr.get("N") {
        Ok(view_count) => {
            match i32::from_str_radix(view_count, 10) {
                Ok(n) => n,
                Err(_) => {
                    // We couldn't parse the string as an i32
                }
            }
        }
        Err(_) => {} // The 'ViewCount' was not an 'N'
    }
} else {}// There is no 'ViewCount' attribute

```

notes:
Here is a verbose version of what that might look like.
Rust will not let you write unsafe code from the start.
You must handle all errors.

---

An idiomatic rust solution

```rust
let viewcount = item.get("ViewCount")?;
let sus_n = viewcount.get("N")?;
let n = i32::from_str_radix(sus_n, 10)?;
```

Each `?` will immediately return the `Result` to the calling function, on error.


notes:
An idiomatic rust solution looks like this.
Don't worry too much about the specifics here.
We'll talk about basic rust syntax soon.

I just wanted to give you a taste.

---

Problems today:
- Security breaches
- ransomware attacks
- operational failures
- safety critical failures

notes:
Broken software hurts people, and slows down human progress

We now have a much better solution to these problems.

Rust is a really pleasant language to write code in.
But that's not what we're here to talk about.

---

We're here to talk about making perfect software.

---


I'm TIRED of trawling error logs for it to tell me: 
- `"unexpected ; in query"`, or 
- `json decoding error on line 1`
- `NullPointerException` (or `NoneType has no attribute`)

notes:
I've been searching for many years for systems, frameworks and methods to make my code more reliable, or guaranteed.
We as developers accept that our lives are governed by errors.
Often bullshit errors like these.

I am here to tell you that it doesn't have to be that way.

## Rust provides memory safety 
## without
## a garbage collector

notes:
You may have heard that "Rust provides memory safety without a garbage collector".

I don't care about memory safety, I've never had to.

Java, python, ruby, node, go - they all ensure memory safety by running a second program alongside your program, checking memory is freed when it is no longer used.

This is called, as you may know, the garbage collector.

The Rust team identified the need for memory safety without a garbage collector as a key problem to be fixed.

So they implemented a genius simple method to keep track of memory, called the borrow checker.

But here's the thing:

---

In fixing memory safety the Rust team

ACCIDENTALLY FIXED EVERYTHING  
  
(that I do care about)

---

In making a compiler that understands your code in a very deep way, and a rich type system that supports that compiler, they gave us, the developers, all of that control, the potential to build the perfect language and ecosystem.

The rust community, over 16 years, has delivered.

---
## Familiar

```rust
println!("Hello world");
```

notes:
Rust has a familiar c-like syntax that javascript, go and java developers will be familiar with. Even delicate python developers such as me won't be too confused.

---

## High level features / Low level speed

```rust
let sum_of_squares: u32 = 
    (1..6).map(|x| x * x).sum();
```

notes:
Here are functional-style iterators, but this is just one of the many zero-cost abstractions that translate down to simple loops

No matter how clever your language is, the processor running your code only understands bits and a few operators.

Rust gets your high-level code RIGHT DOWN to that bare metal without sacrificing high-level developer ergonomics.

---

## Think In Expressions

```rust
if x { // statement
    y = a;
} else {
    y = b;
}
// expression:
y = if x { a } else { b };
```

notes:
Semicolons finally have proper MEANING.

Line-oriented statements come from punched cards.
Punched cards are statements.

We can do better.

---

Think in Iterators

```rust
(1..10).map(f)

names.iter()
    .filter(|x| x.starts_with("A"))
```

notes:
in rust, you think in iterators, as data being transformed through functions.

---

## Options Everywhere

```rust
let possibly_a_number = Some(1);

possibly_a_number
    .map(|n| n + 1)
    .unwrap_or(0);
```

notes:
You can use all iterator methods on `Option`s
No nulls in the whole language

---

## Rich Types Make Invalid States Unrepresentable

```
enum Living { Alive, Dead }
enum Planet { 
Mercury, Venus,  Earth,  Mars, 
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
}
struct Human {name: String, state: Living, home: Planet}
```
```rust
let user = Human {
    name: "Tris",
    state: Living::Alive,
    home: Planet::Earth}
```

notes:
In this example, a human has to be alive or dead, and has to live on a planet. No nulls, no anonymous objects.

In Rust you tell the compiler how the world works, and it will hold you, and everyone who contributes to your code, accountable to the contract you have written.

This may be a new way of programming for you, but it's such a good pattern that this is now how I try to write my python.

---

### Modern Tooling

- **cargo** - packaging, building
- **cargo fmt** - standard formatting
- **cargo test** - doc and unit tests
- **cargo bench** - benchmarking
- **cargo clippy** - code linting
- **rustup** - rust version switching

notes:
Rust has a best-in-class package manager, solving all the dependency nightmares we face day-to-day.

This is what you get when you have a community focussed on correctness.

---

### Async syntax done RIGHT

```javascript
// javascript
const response = await fetch("http://example.com");
const data = await response.text();
console.log(data);
```

```rust
// rust
let data = fetch("http://example.com")
	.await
	.response
	.await
	.text;
println!(data);
```

notes:
In JS if you remember, we had to wait YEARS for async/await to be standardised, and we still can't get it in all browsers.

In rust, it was prototyped as a Macro.

---

### Built-in preprocessing with Macros

```rust[2-5]
let name = "Tris";
let page = html! { 
    <div id="component">
        hello { name }
    </div>
};
println("{}", page);
```

notes:
(the macro used here is `html_macro`)
The language is extended with macros, code that executes at compile time, which are installed as simple libraries, same as everything else.

Macros convert new syntax back to type-safe rust, which is then fed into the compiler.
You don't have to throw out the safety of rust to use new features TODAY

If you've use babel, webpack or the million other javascript precompilers, you've used a bad, error-prone, ill-defined, macro system.

---


Let's look at some real-world rust.

```c
#[get("/hello/<name>/<age>")]
fn hello(name: String, age: u8) -> String {
 return format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name)
}
```


notes:
Here's how you write a simple get request in Rocket, a Rust web framework.

You can probably read this without my help. It's a pattern we've all seen before.

The first line isn't a comment though, it's a macro, which enriches and rewrites the enclosed function before the source code gets passed to the compiler.

It's a simple hello world http endpoint, with built-in compile-level validation of guaranteed-valid utf8 strings, and a rudimentary understanding that people shouldn't be negative years old, or over 255.

I'll admit, that's optimistic validation.

But we can do better, we have the technology.

---

```c
#[get("/published/<id>")]
async fn forms_by_id(id: Path<UUID>) -> FormResponse {
  return sqlx::query_as!(
      Form,
      "SELECT * FROM forms WHERE id=$1;",
      id
    ).fetch_one()
    .await
    .expect("");
```


notes:
DON'T BE SCARED.
I promise we can get through this.

Lets reason about this short piece of code.

It's still using the Rocket web framework, by the way, think of it as an Express, Sinatra, or Flask equivalent.

If our program compiles we know many things are guaranteed:
- `id` will be a valid UUID, from a valid http path
- The return json will ALWAYS be in the schema we designed,  named FormResponse, with defined values acting as the contract we can never break with our API clients.
- sqlx actually runs that query on my local dev database with a valid test input (generated on the type) in a rolled-back transaction at compile time. If it is invalid, my code doesn't compile.
    - Yeah, this is magic. RUST magic.

So far so great, but there's more:
- No memory leaks
- No SQL injection - all guaranteed at compile time
- And you get all of this with no heavyweight, slow abstractions - this all compiles down to for loops and if statements: close to C speed, running on bare metal.
---

## #![forbid(unsafe_code)]

notes:
But We can do even better:
- By adding the `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` directive we forbid 
 the `unsafe` block, and therefore any linking to operating system libraries (ie, external c code), guaranteeing our app is pure rust, and therefore does not break any of our guarantees.
- But what about native libraries that you NEED to link to such as:
    - Libpq-dev for postgres
    - Pandas/Numpy
    - or OpenSSL

The rust community has rewritten all of these in pure rust
Not even OpenSSL has escaped Oxidation.

---

Rust is a language for the next 40 years

- High AND low level
- Code for web assembly, containers, or bare metal chips
- "Fast, reliable, productive — pick three"
- "Fearless concurrency"
- No Rust 2.0

notes:
The last 40 years were written in c, the next 40 will be written in rust.

---


In writing this, I wanted to invite you to get in on the ground floor with Rust, as it's going to be an industry-changing ride.

notes:
However, as I wrote this I realised that actually you have some walking to do.

The Rust elevator is currently on the 16th floor.

---

![[lang-rank-0122-wm.png]]

notes:
There are more rust projects on github than Scala, Kotlin, Swift, CoffeeScript and Perl.

It's time to take rust seriously, first in your personal projects and learning, and soon, at your work.
