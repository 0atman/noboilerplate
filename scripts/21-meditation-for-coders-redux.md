Hi friends my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast, technical videos.

I'd like to talk today about two techniques that have helped me in my career as a programmer that you might be surprised to hear about, Meditation & Yoga. 
I talked a bit about this subject in a bad old video, but I'm going to do it properly today.

I'll start with Meditation.

notes:

As coders we are used to distractions coming from everywhere - email, slack, twitter, mastodon, reddit, the list is infinite.

But there’s an important, invisible, distraction we rarely talk about - our own thoughts. 
Daydreams; zoning out.

They don’t come from the outside, they come from within. You can’t simply put on headphones and disconnect from them or uninstall an app.

# Part 1: Meditation

notes:
Let me tell you my experience with Meditation.

---

![[tris-red-wudang.png]]

notes:

For the first two months of 2017, I studied Kung Fu at a Daoist temple at the top of a mountain in central china.

---

![[quxugong.png]]

notes:

We got up at 6am every day in the freezing cold or snow.

---

![[qigong.png]]

notes:

Practiced Qi Gong exercises to warm up the body.

---

![[todays-special.png]]

notes:

Ate a simple breakfast of rice and vegetables, grown at the temple.

---

![[wuxugong-demonstration.png]]

notes:

Practised kung fu and tai chi all morning

---

![[wudang-feast.png]]

notes:

Had lunch
(it was only this fancy once by the way - I never learned what occasion we were celebrating)

---

![[taichi-wuxugong.png]]
notes:

Then more training in the temple that the town was build around
(spot me in black at the back!)

---

![[daoism-study.png]]
notes:
Then dinner, followed by Daoist study and meditation.

I wasn't very good at the daoist study, but really enjoyed the meditation.

(and tea)

---
![[tris-photo-temple.png]]
notes:
In our 1 day off per week, I took my camera sightseeing and/or slept for 24 hours, depending on how brutal the training had been!

---

![[wudang-mountains.png]]
notes:
When I returned home, I kept up the meditation practice, and switched from qigong to yoga, which serves a similar purpose but is easier to find classes for.

Buddhists meditate

![[christian-meditation.png]]

notes:

All societies have some kind of quiet reflection practice baked into their rituals - why is this so ubiquitous? 

Might it be because it is very useful, perhaps essential to the human experience?

---

> Meditation is the dissolution of thoughts in eternal awareness or pure consciousness without objectification, knowing without thinking, merging finitude in infinity.

&mdash;Voltaire

notes:
Voltaire, the enlightenment writer and thinker, thought so.

---

>The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant.
>We have created a society that honours the servant and has forgotten the gift.

&mdash;Einstein

notes:
Einstein thought so too!

### Your Brain
![[your-brain.excalidraw]]

notes:

Let's talk about your brain. 

There’s an interesting phenomenon that I discovered almost immediately upon practising meditating: 

My internal identity of “self” (that voice in my head I think of as me) couldn’t control the distracting thoughts, at least at first. 

My revelation, which I understand is a common one in meditation beginners was:

---

> If my thoughts were external to my “self”,
>
> where did they come from, if not me?

&mdash; Me, an intellectual

---

![[your-brain-split.excalidraw]]

notes:

The answer is, perhaps, that there are two selves in our brains:

1.  A self that has the thoughts, and,
2.  A self that listens to them.

Meditation strengthens the listening self, the part of you that acts as your willpower, and is the executor of your agency.

---

# Part 2: Yoga

notes:

Lets go back to the exercises I did at 6am. The reason Daoist do Qi Gong is to strengthen the body’s core, for the simple reason that it allows you to sit in meditation comfortably for longer than if your body were weak.

Yoga’s roots are the same. It is widely believed that yoga is designed to complement the main goal of life: to meditate and achieve enlightenment.

![[office-ergonomics.png]]

notes:

- yoga's goals of sitting comfortably for long periods of time match my goals as a coder, sitting programming for long periods of time
	- or gaming
- We all know people who can just sit anywhere, on the floor, tucked up in any chair, cross-legged, or kneeling, seemingly for an indefinite period of time
- If you are not this kind of person, you can learn it.

---

![[treadmill-ball-instanity.png|500]]
(I can't find out if this is a real product)

notes:

- If you can sit comfortably, you don't need a standing desk, or fancy chair, or treadmill desk, or any of that expensive nonsense I personally have tried in the past.
- If you practice yoga just a little each day, or do a longer practice at least once a week, in my experience, much discomfort is alleviated.

---

## Don't just Do Something

# Sit there

notes:

Coders are a group that are HIGHLY ALIGNED to:

1. An exercise that allows you to sit for long periods of time, and
2. A practice that sharpens the mind against distractions and increases focus

Yoga and meditation should be part of every coder's toolkit, just as a good editor, language, or OS is.

![[yoga-book.png|300]]
(not sponsored)

notes:

What are you waiting for?

There’s Yoga classes EVERYWHERE! 
Try Ashtunga, that’s my favourite because it's reassuringly the same whatever class or book you choose.
This is the book I own and recommend, by the way.

You need hardly any equipment or space to do yoga.

---

![[practical-zen-book.png|350]]

(not sponsored)

notes:
And you need NO equipment or space to meditate.

Try reading Practical Zen, I've read a lot of good books introducing meditation and this one is my favourite.

Friends: It’s time to get HEALTHY!

See you next time.
