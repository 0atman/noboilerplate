# The Autism 
# Constellation

### (Or: How to recognise Autism)

<!-- slide bg="[[constellations.jpg]]" -->

notes:

# Introduction: The Autism Constellation

Hi friends, my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast, technical videos.

If you break your arm, the cause is apparent, and the symptoms lead directly back to it.

Autism, does not appear to be like this. We can't yet comprehensively diagnose the biological or physiological root cause or causes.

Autism is a neurological/developmental disorder, not a mental health condition.
And because of the developmental/neurological difference, autistic traits touch so many different areas of life that a mental health disorder typically would not.

Just look at some of the traits that someone with autism can express:

---

### Autism Symptoms (incomplete)

- Anxiety
- Bipolar disorder
- Depression
- ADHD
- Selective mutism
- Schizophrenia
- OCD
- PTSD

notes:

To name but a few.

How do you tell if you are autistic, or have some OTHER condition entirely?

I am not a doctor, but I do have Autism.

The way I picture my varied autistic traits is like a constellation of stars.

---

# Ursa Minor

![[38-autism ursa minor.excalidraw.svg]]

notes:

## Ursa Minor

Because the 7 brightest stars of Ursa Minor always appear in the sky together, we have given them a name, a classification to separate them from all the other stars in the night sky.

But constellations do and don't exist.

---

![[ursa-minor-projection.png]]
notes:

# Extra-terrestrial Star Projection

Looked at from Earth, they certainly seem to. But seen from another point of view, the other side of the Galaxy perhaps, the grouping might not be visible, or be missing some stars, or have gained a few others.

It exists as Ursa Minor only as a presentation to us, a grouping of stars that tend to go together.

For instance: Polaris is 305Ly further away from us than the next brightest star, Ursa Minor Beta, they're not next to each other at all.

I understand the record for hitch hiking 305Ly is just under an hour, but you donâ€™t get to see much on the way.

---

# Ursa Minor

![[38-autism ursa minor.excalidraw.svg]]

notes:

The reason we we make these groupings is because it is very useful to us.

Find a few bright stars in a shape you recognise, and you can more easily find the rest of the constellation, even in conditions that might less than idea.
And once you recognise Ursa Minor, you can orient yourself to the north star.

---

# AUTISM

notes:

- [ ] back to the constellation photo, but this time with AUTISM spelled out in a constellation

Once you've recognised the Autism constellation of behaviours, you can name it.

To name a thing is to control it.

And you can begin to find your way.

# Part 1:

## Detail-Orientated Thinking

notes:

I know two Autism jokes and I will share them both with you in this video.

Are you ready for the first joke?

---

## Joke the First

> Some say that people with Autism take things literally, but they are thinking of kleptomaniacs.

---

# Disclaimer:
## I am not a doctor

notes:

- I have grown from an autistic child who needed weekly lessons from a childhood psychiatrist in order to learn how to make eye contact, into an autistic adult who is flying high in an aeroplane made out of comprehensive coping mechanisms.
- I Am Not a Doctor, just someone who has tried to understand his condition, scientifically and obsessively, for many years.
- I hope explaining what has worked well for me helps others, and gives you ideas for things to try.

An autistic person has a set of traits we group together under the Autism label.

---

### ðŸ‘© Alice is...
- Left-Handed
- An Introvert
- A Visual learner

notes:

Three examples of common non-autistic traits are:
1. Being left-handed,
2. An Introvert, or
3. Being more of a visual learner than auditory learner.

Traits are not inherently good or bad, though they might be better or worse suited to some situations than others.

More on that later.

The way to make sense of this all, is to find repeated patterns and groupings of traits, the same as we do for the night sky.

There does appear to be a unifying autistic core trait, however, which surprised me:

---
### Unifying Autistic Trait:
## Detail-Oriented Thinking

notes:

We don't know the biological cause of autism, but the way I think about my condition is that it is caused by detail-oriented thinking.
I've heard this sometimes called bottom-up thinking.

This is in contrast to thinking in abstractions, sometimes called top-down thinking, where high-level concepts are worked out first, details second.

The question of what causes autism is uninteresting to me, you can't see my biology, DNA or chromosomes, what you can see is my behaviour and my presentation.

For me, detail-oriented thinking is a proxy for the as-yet unknown, currently missing root cause.

And it is a very useful framework

---
# Autism is Extremely Common

notes:

- between 1 and 2 percent of children are autistic, and you don't grow out of it
	- This means that 1 or 2 percent of adults could be autistic and not know they are
- Autism also seems to be extremely heritable
	- if one or both of your parents are autistic, you likely are too
	- But the reverse is also likely true: If you are autistic, ask your parents some questions about how they have experienced their life so far

---


### Detail-Oriented Thinkers Value

- **Our Senses** over what we are told
- **Well-defined Rules** over tacit convention
- **Sticking to a Plan** over improvisation
- **Clear Data** over society's implicit abstractions

_That is, while there is value in the items on  
the right, we value the items on the left more.[^agilemani]_

notes:

This is why emotions can sometimes come slower to us, we're paying attention to the million details around us, and sometimes this causes us to miss the big picture

You often can't simply tell us what to do, we'd prefer it if you also tell us the details of what and why, from the bottom up.

---

<!-- slide bg="[[you-know-the-rules.png]]" -->
<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>
_"You know the rules, and so do I."_

#### &mdash; R. Astley, Philosopher

notes:

- Country to common stereotypes, Autistic people are often more aware of the rules of society than non-autistic people.
- autistic learning is like foreign language learning, I think:
	- We learned the rules more recently then everyone else (we were late to the party)
	- This means the rules are fresher in our minds
	- and we work harder to adhere to them
	- so we often get frustrated when we see other people not following them

societal defaults don't come very naturally to us because they don't often come with matching data:

# Show your working


notes:

autistic people, like mathematicians, want to see how you got to the answer, not just the answer.

---

![[colored-white-water-fountains.png]]

notes:
- some people are better than other people?
- That is an extraordinary claim, without the extraordinary evidence needed to back it up

---

![[two-countries-alike-in-love-of-beige-food.png|800]]

notes:

- The nation I was born in happens to be better than all the others?
- How convenient!

---

![[gender-cuffs.png]]
-- TED.com

notes:

- The clothes I can wear are defined solely by my biological sex?
- That doesn't seem very likely, and needlessly restrictive.
- Who cares?
- Who told you these rules?


---

## You Cannot Persuade Me of the Simplicity of the World

### I Can Only See the Complexity

notes:

And herein lies the problem: Choice.

Neurotypical people more often can choose to employ either detail-oriented thinking or top-down, abstract thinking, depending on the task or situation.

Autistic people can't make that choice as easily, and it defines our lives.

---

## Primary Autism Symptoms

- Social interaction
- Restricted behaviours
- Restricted interests

notes:

This restricted, detail-oriented thinking causes the primary Autism symptoms of:

- regular difficulties in social interaction and communication
	- We are lost in the conversation, and are missing the social cues around us
- restricted or repetitive behaviours
	- We tend not to look to others for behaviours to imitate, so often reach a local maximum we can't break out of
- resistance to change or restricted interests
	- The wider world exerts its influence in large abstractions that can be predicted if you are not focising on the details.
	- Autistic people focus on the weather, neurotypical people can better see the climate.

---

## Secondary Social Effects

- Employment
- Relationships
- Mental health

notes:

These primary behaviours, cause wider secondary social effects, including

- problems in getting or continuing employment or education
- difficulties in initiating or sustaining social relationships
- a history of mental health conditions due in part to the conflict between our traits and a society not set up for people like us.

These problems are just as due to our society, as they are to out Autism.

---

> "There is no such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism"

Have you heard this?

notes:
Here's a thought experiment:

The idea of "ethical consumption" is for consumers to try to spend their money in a way where nobody gets exploited.

But we eventually learn that it is almost impossible in a system designed for value extraction, for someone, somewhere along the line, to not be exploited in some way where they aren't paid properly for their labour or are working in unconscionable conditions, often on our street, right now.

An understandable coping mechanism with this world that we find ourselves in, is to ignore it.

Autism's relationship to society is much like this problem.

---

![[cool and normal.png|400]]

> There's no such thing as "rational behaviour" in society.

notes:

We want to live our lives in a way that makes us happy. But society is set up with implied rules and conventions that perpetuate themselves not because they make sense, but because that's just how we do things.

There is no way to act normally in this system, and for autistic people, this dissonance can be extremely painful.

---

# ADHD Comorbidity

notes:

In addition to the long list I showed early, Autism is extreme co-morbid with ADHD, which complicates diagnosis, as the conditions can sometimes mask each other.

See my video on ADHD for more details there.

Unlike ADHD, which is not typically considered a disability, Autism more often is. The truth is more complex than this binary label, of course.

---

## Disability?

## Neurodivergence?

## Superpower?

notes:

- Is it a disability?
- Is it a neurodivergence?
- Is it, as some people say, a superpower?

I think it can be any and all of these, depending on the person
- A disability
    - An adult who can't make eye contact is indeed disabled by our society according to the Social Model of disability
- if it is a Neurodivergence
    - means that it's a normal part of being human.
    - Just as some people are introverts or extroverts, or a visual learner or an auditory learner, doesn't mean one is inherently better than the other.
    - And so it follows that autitsic thinking isn't inherently better or worse than more neurotypical ways of thinking.
    - This is how I think of Autism.
- Is it a Superpower?
    - someone with highly specialised interests and tendencies to withdraw from society used to be called a genius, a savant, a brilliant artist
    - But this definition troubles me, as I think it can minimise the problems people face by focussing on the advantages and utility of the condition.
    - Normally the utility to your boss, your employment, not to yourself

Which of these categories you fit in to changes from person to person, situation to situation, day to day and hour to hour
- But you can help yourself, as I did, by
	- learning about yourself
	- and testing coping mechanisms.
---

High praise.

notes:

Some of the symptoms of Autism, such as hyperfocus on restricted interests and lack of social aptitude, can be beneficial.
Sometimes these traits cause such apparent genius in people that the person is portrayed in film by Benedict Cumberbatch.

# Aside:
## Chicken or Egg?


notes:

Is it autism, though, that causes the apparent genius, or is it, perhaps, that regular society has many extremely detrimental norms, and not fitting in, sometimes, is actually a really good idea?

## Joke the Second

### Part 2:
## Studying the Patient

<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>
_"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool."_

#### &mdash; Richard Feynman

notes:

If you are autistic, as I am, there are many options you should pursue, and your doctor can help you there.

Today I'm going to set out the only one I feel qualified to talk about: Studying The Patient.

---

## The Scientific Method

1. Observation
2. Hypothesis
3. Prediction
4. Test
5. Refine & Repeat

notes:

Throughout history, we have found out that there is exactly one way to find out about the world around us:
The Scientific Method.

This is especially important, and especially difficult with the mental health effects of Autism.
Richard Feynman said that "Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself." and that is what we must undertake.

Our perception is unreliable, our memory and recall unreliable, and the stories we tell ourselves and the people around us about ourselves are unreliable.

If you are to study the patient, as I recommend, you must find a way to cut through your and society's biases and filters to find ways to cope, or mask or, if you're very lucky, thrive.

---

## Coping Mechanisms

![[heal-yourself-boundaries.png]]

[Heal Yourself, Skeletor.](https://skeletorislove.tumblr.com/)

notes:

With Autism, you can't set the bone in a cast like you can if you break your arm.
It will never heal on its own: You must heal yourself.

The friction between our autistic behaviours and society's expectation of our behaviours cause many of the issues we face day to day.

There are two main ways to ameliorate this:
1. Change yourself, or
2. Change society.

And while the latter is a very important part of our collective story, others can speak on this topic better than I.

I am going to focus on ourselves, the part of the problem that we more easily can influence, and take charge of.

---

### Mental Health Incident Review

1. Write down what happened in the Incident
2. Devise coping mechanisms that you think might improve your situation next time
3. Write down what happened when you used them, the next time the same situation occurred

notes:

In my industry, software engineering, when a bug, crash, or other incident happens, we try to identify the cause and stop it happening again with an incident review.

The same principles work for me for figuring out what went wrong with a societal interaction incident, due to my autism.

---

## Can't you just 
# tell me 
## what to do?

notes:

Suggesting coping mechanisms before working out what went wrong would be to put the cart before the horse, it would be the wrong thing first.

While you may read about my own coping mechanisms in my pinned video here, and maybe some would help you, it is vital to build a practice of continuous improvement for yourself.
You and I only have a little time together, I would rather teach you how to fish than give you a fish.

notes:

A mental health incident review is an example of applying the scientific method to our own mental health.
- Observe the incident.
- Hypothesise the cause
- Come up with a plan that could change the situation next time.
- Test the plan the next time you're in that situation.

You may take many days to finalise the incident review, as more thought brings triggers and other issues to light.

Lets look at a concrete example that all too many people have experienced.

- **20:00** Arrive at party
- **20:15** The music's great! I'm having a good time!
- *SCENE MISSING*
- **22:00** Leave in tears!
- **22:30** Long bus ride home, asking yourself:

**_"Why does this keep happening to me?"_**

notes:

We attended a party with friends, everything was looking up, but something ruined the evening for us, and we aren't sure why.
We're left asking
**_"Why does this keep happening to me?"_**
That's a great question
Don't just ask yourself, test yourself
Let's look at the incident report

#### '5Whys' Analysis

```md
# 5whys: House Party 2024-01-27

1. Why did I had to leave the party.
	- Because I was crying.
2. Why was I crying?
	- Because I was overwhelmed.
1. Why was I overwhelmed?
	- Because it was too loud.
3. Why was it too loud?
	- Because I didn't take a break.
5. Why didn't I take a break?
	- Because I was enjoying myself too much to notice
```

notes:

1. Why did I have to leave the party?
	- Because I was crying.
2. Why was I crying?
	- Because I was overwhelmed.
1. Why was I overwhelmed?
	- Because it was too loud.
3. Why was it too loud?
	- Because I didn't take a break.
5. Why didn't I take a break?
	- Because I was enjoying myself too much to notice

The 5whys section of the incident review lead to one of the possible causes:

If this method sounds like a therapist, there's a reason for that.

There could be more than 5 whys in the chain, by the way, the "5whys" system actually asks as many questions as needed to get to the root cause. We record only the most important 5 in our review.

The 5whys I've demoed here may or may not be valid for you or for me, but I hope you can see the utility in drilling down from surface-level actions and reactions to the underlying causes.

It's also cheaper than a therapist.

```

notes:

The results of a clear-headed mental health incident review could give us the data we need, over time, to build and test new coping mechanisms for the next time we are in a similar challenging situation.

In this case, going for a real or pretend smoke break every hour might help, and to stop us forgetting, we could set a timer, as it's clear that we can't always remember for ourselves!

# Clarification

<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>
_Things are as they are. Looking out into the universe at night, we make no comparisons between right and wrong stars, nor between well and badly arranged constellations._

#### &mdash; Alan Watts

notes:

I want to stress at this point that though I'm suggesting tools and techniques to change our behaviour, this is not a moral judgement about our behaviour.

The coping mechanisms that you discover for yourself are a practical way to cope with wider society so that you can manage each day a little easier.

This is also not to say that society's expectations of, say, eye contact or background music in every public place are inherently good, just because we want to have the option to mask or fit in from time to time.

Masking, like fashion, helps us fit in, when it suits us.

Do it for yourself, not for others.

If you do it for others it becomes problematic.

---

<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>
_"Just because masking becomes automatic doesn't mean it isn't exhausting"_

#### &mdash; What I Mean when I Say I'm Autistic

notes:

## Masking

One of the coping mechanisms that Autistic people use, for better and worse, is Masking.

Masking is suppressing or changing our behaviours to fit with the perceived norms of those around us.

And it's not restricted to Autism, many people mask on a daily basis to fit in with society's understanding of how they should act.

For more details, ask any woman.

---

<!-- slide bg="[[V.png]]" -->

<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>
_"You wear a mask for so long you forget who you were underneath it."_

#### &mdash; V for Vendetta

notes:

We all mask from time to time, such as when we're sad in our personal life, but want to remain professional at work, we can mask until the end of the work day.
We're advised not to bottle up our emotions, as that can have perminant concequences.
But Autistic people are autistic all the time, so we must mask all the time.

And while masking should not be required, it is very useful.
To make and improve your own, you must study those around you, in addition to studying yourself.

---

## Alternatives to Masking

<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>
_"Refusing to perform neurotypicality is a revolutionary act of disability justice._

_Itâ€™s also a radical act of self-love."_

#### &mdash; Unmasking Autism

notes:

- Alcohol is a common coping device many autistic people use.
	- The combination of helping you ignore society's expectation of your behaviour,
	- and the fact that if other people around you are drinking too, they might not notice them either,
	- is an understandable combination of desirable factors.
- But consider this:
	- We can, with practice, ignore society's expectations of our behaviour without chemical help.
	- letting down your guard and being more yourself might mean being letting your autistic behaviours out, and that is ok, around those you trust, because it can make you happier.

---

## Coping with Meltdowns

```md
I will face my meltdown.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past
I will turn the inner eye to see its path. 
Where the meltdown has gone there will be nothing. 

Only I will remain.
```

##### &mdash; Adapted from _Dune_

notes:

Meltdowns affect many Autistic people, and can be caused by a variety of triggers, but for me it was my plans for the future being changed.

I used to become furious when my plans were changed, perhaps by weather, or a delayed train, or someone cancelling.
Strangely, I would be furious even when the changed plans benefited me!
My coping mechanism here is to breathe. If I can go somewhere quiet for 2 minutes, and not talk to anyone, I can get through it.

### Autism first aid kit:
- peaked Cap 
- sunglasses 
- earplugs
- headphones



---

<i class="fas fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-pull-left"></i>
_"Your needs are value-neutral."_

#### &mdash; Unmasking Autism

notes:

The primary advice I wish to leave you with, is that you are allowed to make space for yourself.

- You are allowed to leave the room if it is too noisy, or to wear earplugs or headphones.
- you are allowed to ask people clarification questions when they do not provide enough detail.
- and you are allowed to build and test coping mechanisms to fix the gaps that you perceive between where you are now and where you would like to be.

You're not just allowed to do these things, if they make your life easier or your days happier, I think you should.

And you should start today.
