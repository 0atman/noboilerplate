# Introduction: The Autism Constellation

Hi friends, my name is Tris and this is No Boilerplate, focusing on fast, technical videos.

If you break your arm, the cause is apparent, and the symptoms lead directly back to it.

Autism, like many mental health conditions, does not appear to be like this. We can't yet comprehensively diagnose the root cause or causes.

Just look at the list of symptoms that someone with autism can have:

notes:

# Constellation

I am not a doctor, but I do have Autism.

I don't pretend to know the link between the wide and varied symptoms that Autism presents with, though there are theories for some of them, and I am confident that modern medicine will figure it out in time.

The way I picture this condition is like a constellation of stars.

notes:

## Ursa Minor


Because the 7 brightest stars of Ursa Minor always appear in the sky together, we have given them a name, a classification to separate them from all the other stars in the night sky, such as Ursa Minor Beta, where, according to Douglas Addams, the Hitch-Hikers Guide to The Galaxy is published.

But constellations do and don't exist.

notes:

# Extra-terrestrial Star Projection


Looked at from Earth, they certainly do. But seen from another point of view, another Galaxy perhaps, the grouping might not exist, or be missing some stars, or have gained a few others.

It exists as Ursa Minor only in as a presentation to us, a grouping of stars that tend to go together.
And we make these groupings because it is very useful to us.

Find a couple of bright stars in a shape you recognise, and you can more easily find the rest of the constellation, even in conditions that are less than idea.

And once you recognise Ursa Minor, you can orient yourself to the north star.

And you can begin to find your way.

- which means that 1 in 100 adults could have it and not know they do
- heritable
- if one or both of you parents had it, you likely have it

# My Experience


I forgot I had autism utill I was 25!

I had moved to a new flat in London and was registering with my new Doctor.
During our introdutory appointment, he pulled up my file from the NHS central database and talked himself and me through my history, asking a few follow-up and clarification points along the way.

Towards the end, the doctor said something that stuck with me. He said:

> Tris, I can see there's an error in your file here, which I can correct for you. It says you have Autism, but speaking with you I can tell that's not right is it!

He laughed, I didn't.

I had fooled a doctor into thinking I was normal.

I was hit with a flashback to my childhood.

---

notes:
# My Childhood


- not making eye contact
- social skills difficult
- sensory overload

---

notes:
# ADHD Comobidity


In addition to the long list I showed early, Autism is extreme co-morbid with ADHD, which complecates diagnosis, as the conditions can sometimes mask each other.

Unlike ADHD, which is not typically considered a disability, Autism more often is. The truth is more complex than this label, of course.

So what is it?
- Is it a disabiliy?
- Is it a neurodivergance?
- Is it a superpower?

notes:

# All Three?


I think it can be any and all of these, depending on the person
- disability
    - An adult who can't make eye contact is disabled by our society
        - [ ] find the theory that names this
- Neurodivergence
    - means that it's a normal part of being human.
    - Just as some people are introverts or extroverts, or a visual learner or a auditory learner, doesn't mean one is inherently better than the other.
- Superpower
    - someone with special interests and tendencies to withdraw from society used to be called a genius, a savant, a troubled artist
    - This definition troubles me, as I think it can minimise the problems people face.

Which of these categories you fit in to changes from person to person, situation to situation, and day to day.
- But you can help yourself by
	- learning about yourself
	- and testing up with coping mechanisms.

# Part 2
## Learning About Yourself
- [ ] some fancy "know thyself" imagary

notes:

If you have autism, there are many options you should persue, and your doctor can help you there.

Today I'm going to talk about the only one I feel qualified to talk about: Studying The Patent.

---

# The Scientific Method

1. Observation
2. Hypothesis
3. Experimentation
4. Repeat

notes:
- [ ] check this is the correct thery

There is exactly one way to find out about the world we live in.
The Scentific Method.

==Someone== defined this in a way I quite like

> It's a way of not fooling yourself

Which is especially important, and especially difficult in mental health.
Our perception is unreliable, our memory and recall is unreliable, and the stories we tell ourselves and other people are reliable.

If you are to study the patient, you must find a way to cut through your and society's biases and filters to find ways to cope, or just mask or, if you're very lucky, thrive.

---

notes:
# Coping Mechanisms

With Autism you can't set the bone in a cast like you can if you break your arm.
There are two primary ways to ameliorate autism:
1. Change yourself, or
2. Change society.

And while the latter is a very important part of our collective story, others can speak on this topic better than I.

I am going to focus on ourselves, the part of the problem that we more easily can influence.

---

# Mental Health Incident Review

1. Write down what happened in the Incident
2. Devise coping mechanisms that you think might improve your situation next time
3. Write down what happened when you used them, the next time the same situation occurred

notes:

In software engineering, when a bug, crash, or other incident happens, we try to identify what happened with an incident review.
The same principles work for me for figuring out what went wrong with a societal interaction incident.

This is an example of applying the scientific method to our mental health.
- Observe the incident. 
- Hypothosise the cause
- Come up with a theory that could change the situation next time.
- Test that theory when it happens.

Let's look at a concrete example that all too many people have experienced.

Why a party can be terrible.

- party
- having a good time
- really loud
- power through
- leave in tears

Five Whys

# Clarification:
## Autism symptoms are not inherently bad or good
## Society's expectations of normalcy are not inherently bad or good

I want to stress at this point that though I'm suggesting tools and techniques to change your own behaviour, this is not a moral judgement.

The coping mechanisms that you discover for yourself are a practical way to cope with wider society, so that you can manage each day a little easier.

This is also not to say that society's expectations of, say, eye contact or background music in every public place, or even the nuances of conversation cues are good, just because we want to have the option to mask or fit in from time to time.

Masking is useful, but problematic.

---

# Masking

notes:

Suppressing or changing our behaviours to fit with the perceived norms of those around us.

And it's not restricted to Autism, many people mask on a daily basis to fit in with society's understanding of how they should act.

For more details ask any woman.

And while masking should not be required, it is very useful.
To make and improve your own, you must study those around you, in addition to studying yourself.

---

notes:
## Earplugs


You know how you don't like pubs, clubs, stadia and other noisy places? Surprise! That's called sensory overload, and is an Autism symptom.

wear earplugs to relieve this symptom.

There's a lot of earplug options, from the classic foam cylinders to mouldable wax.
I've heard that wax ear plugs can get stuck in there, so don't use those, I like the ones that look like rounded foam earbuds, very comfy.

---

notes:
## Refuse to Guess


```sh
❯ python -c "import this" | grep ambiguity
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
```

notes:

OK, so while we're talking about Autism, let's talk about all those misunderstandings that happen when you talk to people.

Neurotypical people have a lot more bandwidth available in their communications than you or I do.
They take into consideration body language, tone, vocal hesitations, and extrapolate enormous amounts of information when talking.

AND THEY EXPECT YOU TO DO THE SAME.

You're not going to do that, nor should you have to.

What you're going to do is, at the first hint of confusion or misunderstanding, say "I'm sorry, I don't understand" and let them try again.

If they continue to give you incomplete confusing information, you are going to say again, patiently, "I don't understand", don't worry they won't mind repeating themselves, they all love talking, it'll help them too, trust me.

And if on the third utterance they still don't make sense, you say "I'm sorry, I don't think YOU understand".
Because half the time they DON'T, and it's not your responsibility to teach them how to communicate.

## Build Habits, Chain Them



notes:

There's a good but boring book called Triggers by Marshall Goldsmith, that I recommend you read, or ideally get someone to summarise it for you.

Pay attention to what is making you do thing, its trigger, like a location, a song, a person or a thought.
Then build a feedback loop to improve and chain these triggers together.

---

notes:
## Public Speaking is Important


I'm very good at public speaking NOW, so it all works out eventually, but that is because I PRACTISED a lot.

Yes that thing mum and dad asked us to do for the piano and we never did.

At university you are going to realise public speaking is going to be
1. a problem and
2. mandatory in the wider world.

Pay attention to people who seem like they know what they are talking about and figure out what makes them so good at explaining their thoughts.
Don't bother with persuasion or rhetoric, we're not here for that, we're here to talk to people clearly and precisely.

Study, imitate and practice.

---

notes:
## Imitate


Pay attention to how people act, then do what they do.

This works as well in a sprint planning meeting as it does on the dance floor.
